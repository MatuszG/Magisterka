The House of Splendors is negotiating a deal with the merchants of the Great Work, to see that their wares are distributed among the workers. They are not, however, willing to accept a single item from the House of Splendors, which is why the House of Splendors has offered to trade with the Scions of the Seventh Dawn.

A Bargain Struck: The Enterprise and the Bismarck

The Enterprise and the Bismarck were the first vessels to make use of the Maelstrom's new airshipcraft, the Eremit. Though their designs were quite different, the two were of the same age and made use of similar systems.

Though the two were created for different purposes, they nonetheless shared a similar airship design. This is why it was of great interest to the Scions to examine the two in question, for their performance was of a very high level. And of particular interest to them was the fact that they both served as carriers for the Maelstrom's newest airships, the Eremit and the Bismarck. As such, it was decided that the Scions would take samples of their respective airship models in order to compare their performance.

The Scions arrived on the scene not long after their first foray into the Maelstrom. And though the two ships were different in appearance, they both served to protect the realm from threats both foreign and domestic. Though the Eremit and the Bismarck were constructed for different purposes, they nonetheless shared a similar airship design.
