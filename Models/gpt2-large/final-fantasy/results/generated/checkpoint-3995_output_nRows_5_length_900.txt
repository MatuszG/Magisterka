Dialogue: ['\nYugiri:', "\nAh, Forename, impeccable timing. I was just looking for a trustworthy soul to accompany me on a mission of discovery.\nYou know, a few days ago, I was surveying the area east of here when I came across a curious sculpture.    I wasn't sure what to make of it at first, but then I heard whispers of a man dressed in strange armor─black armor, I think it was─standing amidst the ruins.\nI couldn't make out his face, but I couldn't turn away. I couldn't very well leave the man be, though─the rumors speak of adventurers dressing in strange armor, after all. So I went to investigate.\nIt was at this point that I came across an old map of Eorzea, marked with a strange symbol. I drew a sketch of the symbol, and sent it to my friend. I didn't get a reply, but I'm sure he would have been glad to see me.\nI couldn't find my friend, though, and I was beginning to think that maybe I'd made a terrible mistake. It wouldn't be the first time.\nWell, what I'm saying is, I went to investigate the ruins, and I found this bloody map. And I drew a sketch of the symbol, you see. It's crude, I know, but you can see how it could have been used to disguise the shape of a man's face...\nSo I think it can be proved that this was the man who I've heard so much about. He was likely in the Black Shroud.\nBut where is he, you ask? I don't know, honestly. I think he may have taken some other form, given that this is a place filled with all manner of strange garb.\nIn any case, I'm glad we found each other, Forename. I'll be sure to keep your armor in mind the next time I go on a mission. Thanks again for the help!", '\nYugiri:', "\nWell, well, Forename. I don't suppose you'd be interested in lending an old map of Eorzea to a new adventurer?\nThere you go, a new sketch of the Black Shroud's symbol. I drew it myself, you see, and it's crude, but you can see how it could have been used to disguise the man's face...\nIt looks like my friend was in the Black Shroud. I'd best go and confirm it, but...I don't want to cause any more trouble for the adventurer who sent me on that mission.\nHmmm... Might I ask you to accompany me again, in case there are any other clues to be found?\nThank you again, Forename. I will do my utmost to solve the man's mystery!", '\nYugiri:', "\nWelcome back, Forename. You've been out for quite a while.\nYou made a fine sketch of the Black Shroud's symbol, I must say. And I trust you weren't distracted by the Black Shroud's otherworldly garb?\nI can't wait to see the finished product! It's just so stunning, I can't stop staring at it.\nIt's a pity the armor was so shrouded in mystery, though. It would have been a treat to meet the owner, if only in person.\nWell, I'd best get this armor to the adventurer who sent you. It's important, you know.", '\nYugiri:', "\nThank you again for lending me your time on that mission. It was more than worth it!", '\nKagero:', '\n...!?', '\nYugiri:', "\nAh, Forename.

Now, however, my main focus is the collection of rare artifacts.   Recently, however, I have been requested to assist in a transaction that would see one of my favorite merchants acquire a fantastic find.

It is said that one can use this new method to determine their historical value.  I should point you to the notice board─the notice board is right here.", '\nWlveva:', "Now then, let us speak of the transaction.    It concerns a crystal found within the coffer to the east. This is an ancient currency of Sharlayan, used to convert and exchange wealth.  It is precisely this type of currency that the Garleans were said to use. If these rumors are true, then the crystal could fetch a very handsome price.  "If the rumors are true, then the crystal could fetch a very handsome price.  ", '\nWlveva:', 'Yes, very handsome. Vipsania, I have made my arrangements. Take the crystal to the man in charge, and he will be happy to take it.\nIn the meantime, I suggest you attend to your other commissions. You are free to do so at your leisure.', '\nWlveva:', "Ah, welcome back. I trust the transaction went smoothly?   Ah, yes, this is the very same crystal that Vipsania was able to determine its historical value.   I can see why the merchant is so eager to have it. As I said before, this is an ancient currency, and one of the challenges we face is ascertaining the value of these ancient coins.   We have no shortage of ancient coins, but what we lack is historical knowledge. If we are to properly appraise these coins, we must study their ancient history.  This is something that I am very much looking forward to doing.  "In the meantime, I suggest you attend to your other commissions. You are free to do so at your leisure."]

I have a task that needs doing─this time, at least.\nThe matter you were speaking to Regana about, namely the one to whom the contract was issued, was a simple one, really. Two parties─the High Houses and the Adventurers' Guild─struck a deal to supply the Serpent Reavers with arms.\nThe Serpent Reavers, as you well know, are an organization of mercenaries who, through cunning manipulation of the markets, have made their mark as one of Ishgard's most feared mercenaries.\nThe High Houses, however, saw fit to issue a contract to an adventurer who they deemed not worthy of a retainer. A retainer, in this case, is any person who is granted permission to engage in combat.\nWell, I must say that I found the whole thing rather intriguing. I will need your assistance in verifying the authenticity of the contract, you being the outsider who is granted the authority to engage in combat.\nI would be most appreciative if you could meet with our quartermaster and receive the necessary authorization to engage in combat.\nYou need not accompany me to the desk in the hall. I will await you there.", '\nMussalfret:', 'I trust you have everything ready?\nWonderful, I see.\nThe Serpent Reavers are notorious for their extreme violence.

We cannot allow this to go unanswered!\nI have assigned the task of slaying the creature to none other than one of your ability─the Warrior of Light.\nGo and speak with our man in the hall, and he will furnish you with the necessary authorization to engage in combat.\nGo now, and do not disappoint me!', '\nMussalfret:', 'There you are. I trust you have the necessary authorization?\nWonderful, I see.\nThe contract you have just signed is the genuine article.\nThe High Houses have no doubt been tempted to issue a retainer to you, but I would strongly advise against it.

Dialogue: ['\nGibrillont:', "\nI'm sure you've heard, but we're moving forward with our plans for the future.       \nNow, I know what you're thinking─Aren't they reckless!? Isn't it reckless to start all over again! Isn't it...amazing!? But I say to you, “Resistanceless,” and “bold.” The people of Eorzea need a leader, and I think you're up to the task. If you'd be so good as to gather the people for a rally, we could have it all here in just a few days!\nThe people here are a crossroads of all sorts─traders, miners, adventurers, and soldiers. If you can convince the people here to come out and rally for the Resistance, it would be a tremendous coup for us.\nI know it sounds a bit hasty to just hand the reins over to you, but you've proven yourself capable of leading others. If you can inspire the people here to come out and rally for the Resistance, it could be the moment we finally break the stalemate!\nThe people here are a crossroads of all sorts─traders, miners, adventurers, and soldiers. If you can convince the people here to come out and rally for the Resistance, it could be the moment we finally break the stalemate!", '\nGibrillont:', '\nWell? Were you able to attract even a single person to come out of the woodwork?', '\nGibrillont:', "\nBravo! That's quite a rally! I could tell immediately everyone was on board with our plans.\nBut perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself. Before you go, I'd like you to meet my comrade, Sotan. He's another one of my protégés who's made it his mission to bring people together regardless of differences.\nIf you'd like to see him, you could come and find him by the tent over there. He'll be waiting for you.", '\nSotan:', "\nAren't you one of the Scions, the heroes of Eorzea? I was sure you'd be there at the front lines, but what brings you here today?\n...A letter? Let's have a look, shall we?\n...From...a Resistanceless adventurer? Oh, this is highly unorthodox. I wouldn't expect anyone to write a letter on their own, much less send it to us.\nAre you certain you didn't just hand over the scrip to an old acquaintance? It wouldn't be the first time.\nWhat's more, the recipient is listed as “Resistanceless”─a rather odd name for a cause. Surely you didn't expect that one of our protégés would end up leading the rally?\nBut you are right: this should prove a tremendous coup for the Resistance. If we can manage to bring together even a handful of people, we have the power to break the stalemate and take the lead!\nRight, then. I believe you should take the letter to my comrade in the tent over there. He'll be waiting for you.", '\nGibrillont:', "\nThe people here are a crossroads of all sorts─traders, miners, adventurers, and soldiers.

Hardly anyone knows, but I've been looking through old records and found this passage in Namai Namai. Could you believe it? The name of an ancient Bozjan hero!\nMy colleagues and I have been discussing our findings, and we're all agreed: this is the most fantastic find we have made to date! Could you believe it?\nLegend has it that the Iron mace was wielded by the legendary hero Gordias, who was said to slay his nemesis, the great flood.\nPerhaps our hero was also known for his bravery in battle. I've no doubt that our new warrior will prove to be more than a match for him, and I can't wait to see him take to the field!\nWhat say you, Forename? Will you be joining me in the field?

Given time, these weapons will evolve into true weapons of the Resistance, capable of slaying even the most formidable of beasts.\nUnfortunately, the Hingan elite have yet to seize control of the area.

In the battle for Ok' Gundu, a hero met a hero.\nTogether, we have forged a new destiny for our people. A destiny that will one day take us back to the dawn of Hingan history.\nBut for now, we must settle what has become of Lord Hien. It is not for me to dwell on what has happened in the past. Suffice it to say, I am grateful for your aid, and will not take my leave until you have returned.']
