It is a method of negotiating a lower price on goods that the sinner must accept in exchange for greater blessings?\n“Greater blessings” are oft interpreted as exclusive rights to do with business as one pleases. In this instance, the sinner must agree to trade with the Dravanian Horde for exclusive blessings.\nTo that end, we have prepared a bounty of rare and wondrous items. You must collect them in the form of grilled dodo meat, grilled goobbue meat, and grilled wadjet meat from our creatures─Hrothgar, Garlean goobbue, and Wadjet.\nShould you fail to obtain all three of our bounty items, I am afraid you will have to re-tool the axiom─but with greater blessings!', '\nSeverian:', '\nHow fare you, sinner?', '\nSeverian:', "\nAh, yes─the grilled dodo meat does indeed look delicious!

The sinner who collected the bounty will receive a special blessing, which will increase his or her chances of finding work.\nI will leave the “wadjet meat” portion to you. Simply give it to our creature-keeper, and he will know what to do with it.\nAnd here is the grilled goobbue meat.

I would like you to carry this lesson with you when you negotiate future deals.\nAs an example, I would like you to represent your employer when discussing business with fellow miners.

However, in recent years, pests have taken to infesting the grounds, devouring the precious trees and defiling the sacred grounds with their filth.\nTo be sure, we cannot eradicate all of the creatures that roam in and around the forest, but we can certainly put them down.\nTo that end, we have established an experimental new method for killing pests. We call it “chocobo hunting.”\nThe method is simple: ride a chocobo, and when the bird sees a danger, it will sound the horn. The bird will then come to the aid of its fellow birds.\nUnfortunately, this new method requires a chocobo rider to be present. Alas, I am not entirely unoccupied, as I am presently overseeing the construction of a new chocobo stables. If you would be so kind as to ride your chocobo in place of our own, we can accomplish the task without burdening you with too much work.\nOh, and while you are there, might you be interested in a reward? I have heard a great deal about the fantastic new instruments our chocobos are developing, and I am hoping you might try one for yourself.\nChocobo flute: Hear the sweet sound of chocobo flute as it brings wealth and good fortune.\nChocobo whistle: The sweet sound of chocobo whistle as it brings wealth and good fortune.\nChocobo tailcall: The sweet sound of chocobo tailcall as it brings wealth and good fortune.\nChocobo scratch: The sweet sound of chocobo scratch as it brings wealth and good fortune.\nChocobo squeal: The sweet sound of chocobo squeal as it brings wealth and good fortune.\nChocobo scream: The sweet sound of chocobo scream as it brings wealth and good fortune.\n...What say you?
