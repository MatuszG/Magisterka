This secretion, in turn, attracts beneficial insects to the hive, where they pollinate the nectar.\nWith the advent of the A.I.M.'s A.I.L. program, we may finally be able to answer this most curious of questions. Our new research subjects─be they wild or domestic─were trained to deliver a single, highly specific gift, and were provided with a convenient location to deliver it.\nIt was all part of a larger effort to develop an improved method of pollinating nectar, and the bees' unprecedented cooperation was instrumental in realizing this end.\nIn fact, a single gift alone would not have been sufficient to realize the A.I.M.'s ambitious goals, but the collective gift of the entire colony was instrumental in accomplishing this end.\nIf you would like to know more about the A.I.M.'s plans, I suggest speaking with my colleague, Professor Louisoix.

I fear that our best hope for peace lies in the hands of a man with no military experience─and a rather disconcerting penchant for telling rather odd tales.\nYou see, I need you to infiltrate the Garleans' secret research facility, and procure for me a substance known as “somnus”─a substance which I believe may be of use in the treatment of mental illness.\nThe facility is known as the “Brazen Brookside,” and I believe that a single soldier would be sufficient to secure the necessary materials.\nWith any luck, they will be expecting you─so you need only wait for me to send word of your success.\nI shall be sure to instruct you in the use of somnus─the substance is, after all, one of the most potent remedies known to man. I should hope that you will not have to resort to it in the short term, but if you should experience any side effects while under its effects, I would see to it immediately.", '\nEsmour:', "\nMy best soldier will be along in short order.
