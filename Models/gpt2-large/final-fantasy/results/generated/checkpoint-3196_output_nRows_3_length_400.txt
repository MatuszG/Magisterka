Dialogue: ['\nAlphinaud:', '\nGood evening, Forename. I take it you have your audience with the wily marauder.\nI will not pretend to understand his mind, of course, but I would ask you a question if you have the time.\nDo you know what became of Giah Molk?\nI remember how she labored to bring about peace between our peoples, and how her peaceful efforts were cut short by the unthinkable.\nI pray she is all right.\nBut to ask you a question in such a way...it seems to me a little strange. Giah Molk was a brilliant alchemist─a true genius if ever there was one─and a tireless champion for our cause. She was a woman who cared deeply for her work.\nIn spite of her brilliance, however, she was plagued by a recurring nightmare, a specter that would drag her from her work until she could no longer bear it.\nIt was when this happened that we first learned to speak with the possessed marauder, and that was the first time I learned of his true nature.\nI will not seek to stop him from taking his rightful place in our cause, but I would like you to know of this entity─the specter. Know that it exists, and that it is a terrible one. Do not be surprised if you are attacked by it.\nThe possessed marauder is not a man─he is a specter, a being that has the strength of several men combined. It is a terrible thing─I cannot bear to be near it.\nThe question is not whether you should seek out Giah Molk. The answer is, you should. The sooner you do, the better.', '\nGiah Molk:', '\nForename. I am sorry to have failed you

Title: A Blessed Instrument
Dialogue: ['\nNimbus:', '\nAh, Forename, just the lad I was aimlessly droppin' to in my drunken stupor. Thought I'd finally catch a drink after a gruelin' day of promenading.\nIt's been a while since we last met─nearly a decade, in fact─and I regret not bein' able to give ye a proper thank ye for what ye did fer me.\nI was just lyin' on the beach when I heard a voice callin' me back to the realm. I couldn't believe it!\n'Tis a voice I've heard far too many times since I came to Limsa.\nI was prayin' that the gods would bring me good tidings, but alas, 'twas too late. The bleedin' wind has carried this message far and wide.\nI fear the worst may have happened─I may have been set upon by a marauding horde of Nidhoggian warriors. Whatever ye did, by the Navigator, ye did it well!\nI've never been one to shy away from danger. But I fear I've never known such danger in my life. Aye, I fear I've never known such danger in my life. I thank ye for bringin' me good tidings, Forename. I hope to the Twelve that we may be as friends again.']

Dialogue: ['\nDmitar:', "Blade Surname! It's good to see you. As always, news of your contributions to the Resistance precedes you. We've just received word that the barrier over our new outpost is complete.\nWe've also received word that the barrier will be reinforced with another pair of magitek cannons.\nIf all goes according to plan, we should have our new outpost up and running by the time you finish your shift.\nIf you have a moment to spare, I'd like to ask a question of you.\nIf you're familiar with the Battle of Carteneau, you'll know that we took an enormous risk to bring our new encampment to fruition.\nBut in the face of overwhelming odds, we persevered, and the Carteneau Flats remain liberated. Do you think the same could be said of our endeavor?", '\nDmitar:', "I certainly hope so. I'm curious to know how you think the battle against the Empire will ultimately turn out.\nI imagine there's still a lot we need to learn about the enemy, and we'll be sharing our discoveries with you in the days to come.\nBut for now, I'd like you to have this.\nIn case you're unfamiliar, the Battle of Carteneau took place on the northern fringes of the Resistance's current stronghold. The area was heavily mined, and was home to a variety of insurgent groups.\nBut the main resistance forces were eventually pushed back into the cave-in that is now our new base.\nTo be sure, some of the smaller groups did make it to the cave in, but they were all slaughtered when the main army attacked.\nIn fact, only a handful of the resistance fighters survived the battle, and a good number were captured.\nBut thanks to you,
