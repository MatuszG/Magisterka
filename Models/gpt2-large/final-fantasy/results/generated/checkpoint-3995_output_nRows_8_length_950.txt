It has a unique soul that must be honored.\nAnd if I'm to be honest, I think a good soul can be had for a pretty price.\nIf you're in the market for a new chaser, I suggest you start with Mehvan. He can furnish you with one at a bargain price.\nBut be warned: while he can furnish you with a device at a discount, he won't be handing out the coins. That's right, no charging at all!\nHere you go. My goldsmith will be waiting for you at the Sapphire Avenue Exchange."]

Dialogue: ['\nBlaugybal:', "It was a deal, all right. You see, Limsa Lominsa was promised a fleet of new airships, but the Ironworks and the Sons refused to sell to the Lominsans at all.\nInstead, they negotiated a rather unusual arrangement, in which the Lominsans would receive a small commission for every airship sold.\nWhat's more, since the Lominsans owned the rights to the Churning Mists, any airship that entered Limsa Lominsa was guaranteed a spot in the sky─no questions asked.\nThe problem, however, was that none of the available airships were fit to fly.\nSo the Lominsans turned to one of their most trusted friends in the adventurer trade: Rowena, a former member of the Black Wolf Clan. She agreed to take on the task of negotiating a deal with the Ironworks and the Sons, and she was soon joined by veteran adventurer Haldrath the Red.\nThey met at a tavern in central Thanalan, where Haldrath introduced himself as the proprietor of the Skysteel Manufactory.\nHe explained the situation, and the two men struck a deal that would see Rowena receive payment for any airships sold, in addition to any commission received.\nHaldrath had no doubt been successful in his dealings with the Black Wolf Clan, and so he did not question the wisdom of his arrangement.\nBut when the two men walked into Rowena's reception area, I couldn't help but feel a little concerned... Hm? What did Haldrath have to say?\n"She's Yours is the message he sent, I'm sure.\nAye, the letter made it sound as if Rowena was offering to buy an airship with her commission.\nBut she wasn't. Far from it.\nWhat she was offering was a simple arrangement: payment for any airships sold, as well as any commission received.\nAny doubts you may have harbored have been assuaged─or at least somewhat relieved─by reading the letter.\nAnyway, what you need to know next is that the deal cannot be honored until the ships are in the air.\nSo if you'd like to see your hard-earned savings realized, you'd best act soon.", '\nHaldrath:', "Hm? What's this?\nYou want to see my commission, you say?\nOf course I do! Here it is, in full.\nNow, before you go telling anyone, I won't be receiving a single gil from you. Not from you at all. Not for this task at all.\nNow, you may be wondering why this is so important to me.\nBecause this is the only opportunity I've been given to date, and the only one where I'm willing to accept a commission.

One day, I was musing on a tale from my childhood─a tale of forbidden love─and stumbled upon the subject of an instrument of forbidden history.\nThe tunemaster had mentioned that an Ul'dahn merchant had been selling similar instruments to us for a few years. I knew then that I had found my new muse.\nHe was a dear friend, and a kindred spirit in the pursuit of fine art. I had always admired him, and I knew I could trust him to make the instrument I desired.\nYet, all was not as it seemed. At the time, I believed that the Ul'dahn connection made me a less desirable vessel for this endeavor.\nBut now, I realize that the reason for my disappointment was not so easily traced to myself. No, it was more like this: a desire for history's beauty, and a desire to see it fulfilled.\nSo I resolved to make this instrument fit for a Ul'dahn patron, and so I set to work on it. I poured my heart and soul into this creation, and am grateful to have made it as good as I hoped.\nI would be most honored if you were to use it in your repertoire. Listen well, for its beauty is as beguiling as the tales it tells.\nIt is said that the great Ul'dahn alchemist, Y'mhitra, was fond of the instrument. I daresay he would be pleased to have it in your hands, if only for a moment.\nNow, I must return to my duties. If you would hear the tunemaster's rendition of the melody, pray play it for me at the Waking Sands. I daresay it will lift your spirits.", '\nTunable Instructor:', "\nWelcome back. I trust you enjoyed hearing the tale of forbidden love?\nI hope it serves as inspiration to you on your journey as an alchemist!\nNow, if you'll excuse me, there is a matter I would attend to before you depart.\nI would like you to have this, by way of thanks for your cooperation."]

It is an honor that she was granted such a sacred relic.\nNow, you may be unaware of this, but there was a time when the elementals didn't recognize our kind.\nTo be honest, we didn't mind the elementals at all. In fact, many of us revere them as gods.\nHowever, after the calamitous arrival of the Seventh Umbral Era, many of us who weren't born in the Twelveswood began to question our place in the world.\nAnd it was during this time that Guthlaugur made her pilgrimage to the gates of the Tempest Gate. She was certain she would one day return and bless us again.\nGuthlaugur is an extremely rare specimen of our kind. While there are many who share her passion for the elementals, there are few who are willing to travel to the land of her birth to gather the divine grace she so dearly desires.\nUnfortunately, the elementals have become increasingly hostile of late.\nI can think of no one more suited to protect our sacred place, but I can't bring myself to leave my post just yet.\nPlease allow me to thank you once more for your gift. You have my sincerest gratitude!"]

However, several dastardly plots were uncovered, and the dastardly lords and ladies were made to flee for their lives.\nThey couldn't have gone far, for the area is vast and the grounds uninhabited. So they went to the chocobo stables at Reunion, where the Moulin de Chocobo was born.\nThe noble houses put up stiff defenses, but the Dravanians and the Sahagin were able to slip in and take the field.\nThat was before Garlemald, of course. After the Calamity, we've been forbidden from traveling to Reunion, much less taking up residence there.\nBut I'm certain my lord would be proud to see his knights and his dastardly plots laid to rest─and so I ask, adventurer: would you take up residence at the Moulin de Chocobo? If the noble houses are unable to settle here, perhaps we can find a way to make them leave?\nAye, I think I see a way to end the Dravanian menace. I just need find the courage to go through with it.\nWell, I'd best get to work. Before the day is out, the Dravanians and the Sahagin must be made to leave Reunion.\nI've already hatched a plan. If the noble houses don't leave, we'll take their lands and make them leave with us. That's why I want you to be part of this endeavor.\nSo, what say you? Will you help me make my dream a reality?\nI knew you'd agree! Well, let's get this over with, shall we?\nLord Commander Falkbryda awaits you at Reunion. The dastardly plots can be found to the north.\nSpeak with Falkbryda when you arrive, and she will explain the situation to you.", '\nFalkbryda:', "\nWhat news, adventurer? The dastardly plots have been laid to rest, I gather?\nAnd the Dravanians and the Sahagin have been made to leave Reunion? It's a most welcome development, indeed.\nI would not be surprised to learn my lord has a role in orchestrating this change in policy. I am certain he will want to make himself clear, however─so we shall speak on the matter at our next meeting."]
