There's the matter of the precious gemstone itself.\nIt took a fair amount of searching, but we finally located its resting place in the ruins of Nine Ivies.\nYou see, the gemstone was originally a part of a necklace that belonged to a noble house─Vira Nilya. The family scattered the gem throughout the realm, but the final resting place was in the ruins of Nine Ivies.\nIt's said that the owner intended to keep the gemstone in a similar manner to how he or she would have worn it when they were alive, but the gemstone's power has grown so great that they can no longer do so.\nIn fact, it's said that Vira Nilya was ultimately buried in the ruins in the same manner that the owner was.
