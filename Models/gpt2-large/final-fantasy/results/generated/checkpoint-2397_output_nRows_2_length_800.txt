Well, I suppose there's nothing better than a plan, if you ask me.\nYou see, the plan was hatched by an accomplished goldsmith named Mutamix. And when he heard that the goblins had dug up the precious gemstone, he knew he had to act.\nHe took a handful of gems and scattered them throughout the mines. The miners would then pick them up and take them to the designated places.\nThere were five places, but the gems were scattered in such a way as to leave no stone unturned.\nIf I'm not mistaken, the gemstone was first discovered in the ruins of Nabaath Areng.\nFrom there, it was taken to the ruins of Nabaath Areng, where it was eventually found by Mutamix and his crew.\nHe was so confident that he was prepared to wait days for the gemstone to be found, that he even offered to pay the goblins in advance if they would wait for him at Nabaath Areng.", '\nMutamix:', "\nHinu Vali?

He's a brilliant goldsmith─and one of the most dependable individuals I've ever met.\nWhen I heard that the goblins had found the gemstone, I had no doubts that he would take it and make an excellent necklace. But as it turns out, I was wrong.\nWhen the goblins found the gemstone, they dug in so deep that they actually came across the buried treasure beneath.\nMutamix wasn't expecting that, and it made him nervous. But when he saw that the gemstone had finally been found, he burst into tears.\nIt was then that I came up with the brilliant idea of my own─to create a necklace for the master of the plan.\nI knew that if I combined the bestiality of the goblins with the beauty of the gemstone, it would be a masterpiece of the highest order.\nIt took me five long and sleepless nights to come up with the brilliant idea, but I'm proud to say that I came up with the perfect plan for the master of the plan─and for me─the bestest necklace ever made.\nYou'd best take a look at it yourself, yes? You'd best take a look at it yourself, yes?", '\nHinuvali:', '\nYou're too kind! Now that I think of it, the gemstone you dug up was the exact size and shape of the necklace I gifted you with, yes?\nMarvelous, isn't it? I can't wait to see what you'll make of it!']

You'll be pleased to hear that our efforts have already caught the attention of the wisps, for whom the creation of these fearsome beasts is a prime duty.\nMogret will be pleased too, for his work has already earned him a place of honor in Thanalan, and his name is written across the ancient ruins that dot the landscape. So you'd best go and let him know.", '\nMogret:', "\nAh, adventurer! I trust you've finished with your preparations? I'm pleased to say that we have a readymade armory of our finest weaponry for the bee-sized menace!\nWe need but slay a single of the pests─say, a single queen bee─and that's all we need to complete the design.\nI'd like to think that the wisps are impressed by our efforts, and that they'll let Mogret know that we're serious about taking the bee-sized menace to the next level.\nI'll need you to slay a queen bee, but I'd like you to also bring me its wings. That's all I need to know to finish the design.", '\nMogret:', '\nYou've finished your preparations? Good, that means we can finally move forward with the creation of our latest masterpiece! In fact, I must say that I was quite surprised to receive such a warm welcome from my friend Mogret himself.\nIn case you've been living under a rock, or under a desk, or under some other equally unworkaday location, I ask that you direct your ire at the wisps. The creature is a prime target for their derision, and they'd do well to know it!\nI would also strongly advise you to refrain from attacking the creatures directly. That said, if you should find yourself facing off against a single of them, I would advise you to employ all the techniques you've come to know and love.\nI would also strongly advise you to refrain from attacking the creatures directly. That said, if you should find yourself facing off against a single of them, I would advise you to employ all the techniques you've come to know and love.\nI could not have done it without the help of you, adventurer. Thank you, and I hope that you'll come to regard the wisps as our trusted allies in the battle against the abominations.\nI shall leave you to your work, but I would strongly advise you to attend to your personal security. Remember that the wisps are a formidable foe─be on your guard!"]
