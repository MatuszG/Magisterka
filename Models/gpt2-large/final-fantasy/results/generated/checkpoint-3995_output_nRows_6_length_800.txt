As I trust you are aware, the Crystarium was built to honor the memory of our departed sisters and brothers, and to provide a space for their remembrance. Our greatest sacrifice was that of Brother 72, who sacrificed himself to protect our home. For him, the Crystarium stands as a testament to the unending tragedy that has befallen our people. And it is for this reason that I have been striving to create a space that can provide such a place. I am pleased to inform you that the muse has been found! In his spirit, Brother 72 has chosen to reside within these halls, and I am honored to have his presence extended to the farthest reaches of Eorzea! In fact, I recently had the honor of hosting a reception for the visiting dignitaries. While it was intended to be a celebration of the two nations' united front against the Empire, the guest list was so large that the Serpents, who had to turn away several delegations, were forced to turn away even more. In the end, only a handful of them made it to the ceremony, and even they were unable to attend due to other pressing matters. In the end, only one person from each nation made it to the ceremony: you, Forename! Having received word of your intentions from my superiors, I have been assured that the Immortal Flames will be escorting you to the ceremony. Should you have any difficulty in making your way here, I would be at your side. And Forename─may I say this?

At the rate they are requesting, I daresay we'll soon run out of stock.\nBut enough talk─how do you feel about your work?', "\nG'jusana:", "\nWonderful. Here is your payment. I hope the techniques you used to create these scrolls were as effective as they claim.\nAnd here is your scroll, which I have affixed with a certificate of authenticity.

Dialogue: ['\nTroubled Father:', "\nOh, hello there. I was just wondering, have you ever had any trouble with boys your age?\nAs a matter of fact, I'm sure I'm not the only one who's had difficulty with this. As I understand, it's a fairly common occurrence, though I'm sure it's worse for boys your age.\nI'd be most grateful if you could introduce yourself to the boys in my predicament. I can think of three that would be most eager to meet you.", '\nLost Boy:', "\nAye, I'm Lost Boy. Who are you?\nLost Boy? Oh, it's you! I thought I'd be the first to approach you, but I suppose it's best if you approach me.\nI was hoping to meet a friend of mine, you see, but he's recently been conscripted by those damn imperials. I'd hoped to escape by making a run for it, but they caught me by surprise and threw me to the floor.\nNow, I'm lucky I didn't get killed, but it's a miracle I made it this far. I'd like nothing more than to meet you, but I can't go on living in fear.\nIf I could make it out of this situation, I would. If I could just get away from this place, I...I don't even want to imagine what would happen to me if not for you saving me.\nI don't suppose you have time to talk? I'm sure Lost Boy is more than eager to meet you.", '\nTroubled Father:', "\nWell? Have you had any trouble getting the boys' attention?\nThe three of them are quite eager to meet you. It wouldn't do for them to falter in their pursuit of a hero.\nI imagine that's about the extent of their interest.\nI'm sure Lost Boy and his friends are far more interesting. Perhaps you could go and speak with them later?"]
