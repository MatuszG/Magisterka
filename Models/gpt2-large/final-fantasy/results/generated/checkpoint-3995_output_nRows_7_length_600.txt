The effect is said to be akin to that of direct contact with the aetherial energy flowing through the skin.\nTradition holds that, when the blood is allowed to clot, the crystal within solidifies, allowing one to gain access to a realm beyond our own.\nAlas, few believe that drinking the potion will in any way free one from the binds of aether.\nBut I contend that if the gem is of sufficient size and quality, it may succeed where so many have failed.\nI've not forgotten where I came up with the idea, you see. Aye, the very same place where I bade you take that potion.\nI've imbued it with the selfsame crystal that serves as the focus for my Divination.

Dialogue: ['\nYugiri:', '\nYour efforts on behalf of the people of Gyr Abania were genuinely commendable. It is only right that you be made privy to our findings.\nThough our findings thus far have focused on the role of alchemy in the creation of the Resistance weapons, there is yet one more ingredient that warrants further study: blood.\nA recent survey of the city streets has unearthed a mysterious substance common to both alchemical and goblin concoctions. The substance, when combined with other ingredients, results in a unique type of catalyst that is capable of catalyzing the creation of both explosive and non-explosive concoctions.\nOur survey of the streets also unearthed a goblin recipe for creating a substance with similar properties. Our research will continue, but I am most eager to get to work at once.\nThe catalyst you have uncovered is an essential ingredient for the creation of both explosive and non-explosive concoctions. It is essential to our success─and, perhaps, your own longevity besides.', '\nYugiri:', "\nA goblin recipe for creating a substance with similar properties? I have not the slightest idea what you would need to concoct such a concoction, but I daresay you know someone who does.\nYou have done an outstanding job of informing us of the methods used to create the Resistance weapons. I do not believe there is a man alive who does not possess an understanding of alchemy.\nI am most heartened to hear that you have not been limited by your profession. I am proud to have been able to serve you so admirably.\nIt has been my pleasure, sir, to assist you in your endeavor. I will be sure to keep your skills and knowledge in my mind when I make my next step.\nReturning now to the subject of your investigation, I realized something─I am finding that I am becoming more and more of an alchemist.\nThis change in perspective is certainly paying dividends. I feel more in touch with my inner alchemist, and I suspect I will be able to draw on that knowledge to great effect in my research.\nBefore I depart, I would like you to have this. It is a token of my gratitude, and a reminder that I shall be calling upon you again before long."]
