Dialogue: ['\nBerkoeyaloetahlsyn:', "\nWell, if it isn't our good Forename! How might I be of service?\nYou see, last week, my hive was plagued by a strange buzzing noise. When I went to investigate, I found...\nHmmm... If I were to exterminate the pests, I'd need far more than just a few bees. I'd need a legion!\nNo one knows for sure how many bees are needed to do the job, but I imagine that a decent number would be far more than my meager collection. I'd be most obliged if you could retrieve a few from my hive.", '\nBerkoeyaloetahlsyn:', '\nWere you able to find a decent amount of bees for me?', '\nBerkoeyaloetahlsyn:', "\nHmmm... Yes, I believe I have enough. You might be surprised to know that bees are extremely fond of nectar.\nYou see, nectar is what gives bees their honey. If we don't pollinate it regularly, we lose our only source of a sugary sweetener.\nWe don't simply dump it out, though. We mix it with other ingredients, making it something that bees enjoy eating. In fact, a good many of my fellow bees prefer the nectar to their meals.\nIn fact, it's one of the few things they'll take with them when they're leaving to find a new home.\nYou see, even if I wanted to destroy the buzzing pests, I would need far more bees than I have. And I know full well that a large swarm of bees would overwhelm me.\nThat's why I'm looking for a more efficient way to get the bees out of my hair. One that doesn't involve so much bloodshed.\nThat's why I'm hoping you might help me. Take this. It's a hiveswax comb, a simple tool that I've been using to gather nectar from the hives.\nIt's something of a miracle that I even have bees at all, let alone the number I need. If we could only cull the population to the proper number, we'd have an amazing crop of honey."]

I would suggest you speak with him first, and find out what he has to offer.\nBefore you do so, however, there is a supplementary matter that must be resolved.\nDo you believe that the souls of your ancestors can be reincarnated? If so, what manner of soul would you like to see reborn?\nI ask this because the books contain an alchemical compound known as Thal, which can be used to create a similar type of soul crystal.\nThe crystallized form of this substance is what we call “a soul crystal,” and the method by which it is used is entirely up to the individual.\nFor the sake of convenience, I will refer to this crystallized soul crystal as a reincarnation prism. Simply put, you wish to find out what manner of soul you might be reborn into.\nIf the crystal is to be used in this manner, you will need to possess a crystal of sufficient strength.\nAnd while I would not suggest attempting to pierce the barrier between this world and the next at your own peril, you may wish to seek out a crystal-enhanced individual, such as myself, should you have the opportunity.\nI am pleased to say that I can provide such assistance.\nYou will need to pay a visit to the Amalj'aa stronghold in upper La Noscea─the place in which the crystallized soul crystal is found─to acquire the necessary crystals.\nAnd when you have acquired them, pray deliver the memories of your journey to my colleague, the one known as U'odh Nunh.\nIf you would like to know more, pray speak with him first, and learn of his efforts to recreate a soul crystal of the proper strength.",
