He continued to pursue the ideals that he believed in and died a hero.\nOdin was a great warrior and a great poet as well. He was one of our most beloved members of the church, and we would often visit him even after he died.\nTo see him with his dying gaze and hear his voice singing in the wind... It brought tears to my eyes.\nThank you for retrieving these poles. There are many more that need collecting around the church. Please tell our children of Odin's memory.\n']
