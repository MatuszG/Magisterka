Who would've thought that the bees would be so cooperative?\nYou see, we've devised a method by which we might create a more efficient means of pollination. While this may sound rather counterintuitive, I assure you that it is in fact quite logical.\nSimply put, in order to ensure a consistent supply of nectar, we must pollinate each and every flower in bloom. But if we fail to do so, the flowers will perish without sufficient nectar to sustain their population.\nIn order to solve this conundrum, we've devised a solution that involves a rather unorthodox method of creation. Rather than taking an existing flower and modifying it with our beeswax, we decided to make a new one─in this case, a yellowjacket bloom.\nUnfortunately, we had no idea how to best use one of these blooms, and so we were faced with creating a new one from scratch.\nConsidering that such a feat would likely require a great deal of time, I can only imagine how much trouble we would have been had we attempted it in the first place.\nHence our decision to partner with the bees, rather than attempting to create our own unique flowers. I hope you'll agree that it was a wise decision.", '\nLalai:', '\nAh, the beeautiful plan! You are truly a wonder!\nWith the help of the bees, we were able to create a bloom that is both inconspicuous and incredibly efficient at pollinating flowers.\nSimply put, if you were to place this flower anywhere on the face of a flower, it would pollinate that flower without being noticed.\nIn fact, I think it's safe to say that you would never guess that the flower you placed was the source of nectar.\nThe flowers you created are so inconspicuous, in fact, that I doubt even our bees would have noticed the presence of the flower.\nAnd to ensure that the flowers remain inconspicuous, they are fed a special concoction containing a mix of honey and flower seeds. Thus, we never need to ask the bees to pollinate our flowers─we can simply leave them be for the most part.\nI'm sure you've noticed that our method of pollination is rather inefficient. While it may seem like a small change, it makes a world of difference!\nAs a botanist, it is my responsibility to see that the garden is maintained in a healthy state. And I am pleased to say that our beeswax has done a fantastic job of keeping the flowers healthy and thriving.\nIn fact, I believe that our beeswax has saved us from having to purchase more nectar from the nearby hive, as well as allowing us to create a more efficient means of pollination.\nNow, if you will excuse me, I have a rather interesting report to share with you.\nAs I mentioned before, I was curious to see how the bees would respond to our unconventional method of creation.
