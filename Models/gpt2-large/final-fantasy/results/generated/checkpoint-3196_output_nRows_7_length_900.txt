If you had not intervened, or if some other unit had sent word of the ambush, mayhap more of the dead would have come to light.\nThe truth is, Lady Laniaitte has been on edge ever since the Ala Mhigan envoy arrived.\nWhenever she receives a dispatch from her superiors, she will invariably turn to me, with a pained expression, and ask, “Why is this happening?” She will never get over it.\nBut I refuse to give up. I will continue to search for answers, and to research what can be done to improve the Mhigan response.\nI apologize for making you feel uncomfortable─I knew it would be a while before I could properly express my gratitude.

Eliminating the main source of larvae; b. Maintaining a sufficient number of drones; and c. Preventing the reestablishment of the population.\nTo ensure success, we must reduce the number of drones by a large amount. I would ask you to gather thirty of each of the following: a. Aqueous humor; b. Nanoprobes; c. Aqueous humor and nanoprobes.\nLet me know when you have completed your tasks.\nWeaken the main source of larvae. Maintain a sufficient number of drones. Prevent the reestablishment of the population.", '\nSeverian:', "You have collected the thirty items I asked for? Excellent. I shall proceed with the final stage of my plan.\nWith regard to a suitable number of drones, there is only one viable option.\nShould we succeed in reducing the number of larvae, they will no longer be a threat to our crops. This will facilitate the reestablishment of the population, which in turn will facilitate the restoration of the forest.\nIt is of utmost importance that we do not allow the reestablishment of the population to go unchecked.\nI trust you understand what I mean by that. With your help, we will accomplish all three objectives in a responsible and timely manner.\nI look forward to seeing you again in the fields. Till then, I bid you happy gathering!"]

They were originally intended to be used on crops, but have recently been applied to wild animals as well.\nThe idea is to see how they fare in the wild before making any final decisions.\nAnd that's not all, by the way. We also have a prototype for a new kind of flower, the bumblebee.\nYou might recognize it as a parasitic organism, but one that only flowers once a year. Once a bumblebee has been placed in the proper environment, it will no longer be a parasite.\nIn fact, I'm quite certain that the bumblebee is what's responsible for pollinating the Josseloux pesticide.

If you could lend me a hand, I'd be forever grateful!\nI need you to retrieve a choral instrument from the storage area. You'll find it in the cabinet to the north.\nI would go myself, but I'm too busy practicing to make time.

Did you bring me my choral instrument?', '\nDrest:', '\nOh, thank you so much! I had to practice so much to get ready for our guildmaster's lessons that I completely forgot!\nAs an amateur choral musician, I can't really judge the quality of an instrument's performance, but I know for certain that a good choral instrument has to sound great regardless of what the performer is singing.\nI'd never be able to achieve such perfection if I only used my voice, though. For instance, the song I'm currently practicing is called "The Crying of Loteria's Sister.", and it's a ballad about a young lady who's found love.\nI hope the song helps you to get back into the swing of things, Forename.\nI will be forever grateful if you continue to support us! Please come back to visit again!']

If he attempts to sell it, you will be the one to bring it to him. If he attempts to deceive you, well...that's not so different from what you would expect.\nI am confident this will prove a turning point in our struggle.

Dialogue: ['\nResistance Councilor:', '\nGreetings, sir. I am Ser Marcelain, ranking officer of the House Durendaire.\nI bid you welcome to the Resistance. We are a proud people─a proud nation─and we are ever ready to fight for our cause.\nYou have come at a most opportune time. We have a common enemy─the Empire. And we have a common cause. We are determined to drive the Empire from our lands.\nThat is why we must needs expel their soldiers from our lands. Of course, we cannot do it alone. Generous as you are, you are not well suited to this task. Might I trouble you to travel to Dyrstweitz, to the encampment to the south? There you can seek assistance from a man who is not only Dyrstweitz's acquaintance, but a fellow Resistance fighter as well.\nI am told there are men there who are veterans of the Garleans' assault on Castrum Oriens─soldiers who fought courageously to the last man. I would ask you to speak with them and offer your assistance. If you would do us the service of demonstrating our resolve, I would welcome your company.', '\nCitizen:', "\nI'm here to report in. I've been told to report to Camp Skull Valley by Ser Marcelain. He said he'd be along shortly.\nWhat? You're not here to listen to my tale? Fine, then. I'll keep it short.\nMy unit was tasked with keeping watch on the Castrum Oriens from the south. We were expecting a band of Garleans to come through the gate, but to our surprise, they all came in one big mass. So we had to turn around and head back.\nI was thinking of making a stand and watching our enemy from the cliff, but I'm not quite sure how I'd go about it. Do you think you could lend me a hand?\nI'll go ahead and find a vantage point from which to watch the Garleans from a distance. From there, you'll be able to keep an eye on them from a safe distance.", '\nResistance Councilor:', '\nGo to Dyrstweitz and speak with the men there. If you would offer your assistance, speak with the citizen and retire to a more secluded location.', '\nCitizen:', '\nI have nothing of importance to report. I was just doing my bit to keep the Resistance fighting.', '\nResistance Councilor:', '\nAh, there you are. I trust you were able to find the men?\nExcellent. I knew I could count on you. Now, I suppose you could speak with Marcelain for further details? He told me all about your journey here.\nTell me, do you think this will all come to a head in the coming week or so? Will we be fighting to the last man? Will we be living to fight another day?\nI cannot say for sure until I see for myself. But I hope I can count on you to keep the people of the Resistance fighting till the last man is done fighting.', '\nMarcelain:', '\nAh, you are returned. I trust Ser Marcelain was able to help you to an understanding of our cause?\n...I see. Well, we are both glad to have you with us. To business, then. We are counting on you to keep the people of the Resistance fighting till the last man is done fighting.']

Title: A Brave Resolution
Dialogue: ['\nResistance Councilor:', "\nI see... I see. I thank you again for your service. We are at a critical time, and our nation must be ready to repel any aggression.\nI speak of the looming threat of the Empire's new toy─the Ultima Weapon.\nIt is my understanding that the councilor tasked with overseeing the weapon's construction is currently in the midst of completing a report.\nIf, as seems likely, the weapon is to be used to great effect against our enemies, the councilor may want to reconvene to discuss the next step.\nI would be ever so grateful if you could deliver this copy of the report to the Resistance councilor in my stead.", '\nResistance Councilor:', '\nGreetings, Resistance councilor. I take it you have completed your report?\nVery well. I shall have to summon the relevant ranking officers to the council for a meeting to discuss the next step.\nShould you have a moment to spare, I have a question for you. Do you know of a suitable location for a tactical briefing on the Ultima Weapon?\nThere is a mountain southeast of here, directly to the north of Castrum Abania. I would suggest you seek out this mountain and speak with a Resistance member there.\nShould you have a moment to spare, I have a question for you. Do you know of a suitable location for a tactical briefing on the Ultima Weapon? There is a mountain southeast of here, directly to the north of Castrum Abania. I would suggest you seek out this mountain and speak with a Resistance member there.\nOh my, this is perfect! I should love to hear the thoughts of an able commander!\nI am so glad our nation is not facing another Great War. I only hope the Resistance members here are prepared for what awaits them in the field.\nUntil we are, I will pray for your victory and safe return.

But where could I go?\n<sigh> I fear that is as good as saying I have no choice but to wait.\nPlease hurry, there is no time to lose!', '\nResistance Councilor:', '\nPlease hurry, there is no time to lose!', '\nResistance Councilor:', '\nThe mountain southeast of here is just to the north of Castrum Abania.

Title: A Brave Resolution
Dialogue: ['\nMaucolyn:', "\nI hear you've got a knack for getting things done, Forename. Well done on behalf of everyone here at the guild!\nNow, what do you reckon the resolution will be? I'm not sure I like the idea of a levy that can't do its work...\nHmm... Let me think...\n“We the Skaen honor the memory of those who fell fighting the dragons.”\n“We the Skaen pray for their souls and bid them a peaceful return to the Twelveswood.”\nThe levy's position on that is...doubtful. The fact that they can't agree on anything at all is concerning.\nI suppose that's fine by me. The levy's here to do its part to keep the forest healthy and strong. It can't be a happy thing when the people of the Twelveswood have to suffer because of bickering over who's in charge.\nIf you think this is a problem, though, why don't you speak with the levy's leadership? I'd like to hear their take on the matter.", '\nMaucolyn:', "\nYou're looking for the levy leadership? Hmmm... I'm not sure I like the idea of a levy that can't do its work.\nIf you want to know what the levy's position is, ask the leadership. I can provide you with the details from here.\nI can't imagine the mood in the hall should be better than it is now if you ask them about their disagreement. Be polite, though─the folk here are used to dealing with stubborn folk.\nThe levy leadership is in the hall to the north. I'll give you a hint as to where to find them."]
