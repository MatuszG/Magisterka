Dialogue: ['\nVarthon:', '\nAh, Forename. I trust you have made good progress with your investigation?\nAs I expected, the weapon you recovered is an ancient Thaliak. The only difference is that the alloy used to make it was discovered in the throes of the Calamity, and thus is far more difficult to come by.\nIt is no easy thing to track one down, let alone take one apart. Yet I see no reason why you should not be able to make good on your word.\nLet us go and speak with Varthon. He should be more than familiar with the situation.', '\nVarthon:', '\nVarthon, I presume?

I was hoping you might help with a rather interesting matter.\nAs you know, we recently found an ancient shipwreck off the coast of eastern Thanalan. While some of the wrecks are quite massive, the bulk of them are quite small, making them ideal for fish.\nWith that in mind, we thought we might try to catch as many fish as we can while we can, which is why we're heading out to the area right now.\nI know that sounds like a lot of work, but we're in no position to leave our post at the moment.

I am pleased to say that the Syndicate has a rather sizable surplus.\nNow, while you were initially reticent to accept our offer, I sense that you have come to see it in a more positive light now. A valuable gain, I would say.\nIt may be that you have heard whispers that the Syndicate has ties to the Calamity. That is well, but I would rather not discuss the subject here.\nBut I shall, of course, make it clear that this payment is contingent upon your delivering a number of items to the Syndicate─a task which can be completed only with the aid of a sylph.\nI look forward to your return.

Dialogue: ['\nAlphinaud:', '\nLet us see here where this bargain took place.\nAfter Master Garlond bid the Crystal Braves farewell, the three Braves pooled their funds and purchased the rights to a piece of land in exchange for a reward.\nBut it was not all plain sailing. While the Braves were able to purchase land, they also encountered fierce resistance─which was to prove a challenge for even the stoutest of Braves, let us say.\nA number of the Braves were wounded, and it became clear that more than one of their comrades would perish without proper treatment.\nFor this reason, the Braves pooled their funds and pooled their men for the purpose of forming a unit and taking on additional mercenaries.\nBut that is not all─the other half of the bargain was that the three Braves would each receive payment in various forms.\nIn exchange for these services, the Braves agreed to aid the Gnath in their fight against the Crystal Braves. It was agreed that, should any of the three members of the unit perish, their bodies would be fed to the Gnath.\nWe have all heard the tales─to think that we would actually meet in battle. It is no wonder that the Gnath find it all too grisly. But to our great joy, all three of our fallen comrades are now in a better place.\nThey say that

I'd be lying if I said more beasts wouldn't be welcome at the Stables, but I'd also be lying if I said I had any desire to slay all of them at once.\nI would, however, ask that you refrain from doing so until we have a better idea of what manner of creature this is.

Well, I'll wager you're curious to know how this bargain got off the ground.\nAs you know, the House Dzemael Consortium has been working on a new moon-sized gas giant─one that could house not only our new moon, but also a massive settlement for our people to call home.\nA great many of the Consortium's workers are from Ul'dah, and thus it naturally followed that a great many of the city's citizens would be interested in moving to Ul'dah to join their new home.\nAnd so the citizens banded together, and formed the House Dzemael Citizen Participation Committee.\nAnd, as you can see from the map, there are now citizens of all races and creeds who are willing to give their time and talents to help make this dream a reality.\nIt's no small feat to pull this off, and we'd do well to have the support of the many who live here in Ishgard.\nI would ask you to make a contribution of sorts to the citizen participation effort─say, by helping to build or improve a shelter, or by volunteering to help tend to some farm work.
