Dialogue: ['\nPapin:', "\nWelcome to the Quicksand, friend! I am Papin, a sentry of Bentbranch Meadows.\nThe name's Papin, by the way. You'll know me when you see me─I'm always there when you need me.\nNow, what I'd like to do is ask a few of your friends what they think of the Quicksand.\nIf you've a moment, I can't think of a better place to start off than with a stroll around the plaza.\nIf you've a moment, I can't think of a better place to start off than with a stroll around the plaza.\nAh, and if you happen to see a girl over there by the name of Hihira, I've heard her give you quite the quandary.", '\nHihira:', "\nQuinsoir! Is that a man dressed in the same manner as me?\nAh, the “man in black.” Well, I daresay he isn't dressed like me.\nI must confess that I'm rather surprised to see a “man in black” at a place like this. I'd been expecting someone from the village, at the very least...\nWell, I'm all for entertaining the notion that the Quicksand may be a place of secret passageways and arcane secrets.\nThat said, I must confess that I've no inkling as to how or why the place has been chosen. I've only heard rumors, and even those I've read are of rather concerning nature.\nOh, but before you ask, I've no interest in playing along. I've no desire to deceive anyone, least of all the people of Bentbranch Meadows.\nIn any case, I'm sure you've had your share of run-ins with the supernatural─and you're no stranger to that, I'm sure!", '\nPapin:', "\nWelcome back! I trust you had a good time?\nHah, so Hihira thinks the Quicksand is a place of secret passageways and arcane secrets...\nAh, but that's not how she sees it at all! Hihira sees it as a place of hope and possibility, where the rich variety of life can flourish.\nSo much so, that she's willing to overlook the rather troubling rumors about the place if it means the village will have the opportunity to welcome even more visitors.\nI'm all for helping to make that a reality, but I've no doubt that you're a more skilled traveler than I am.\nIf you want to find out more about the Quicksand, speak with Hihira at the Quicksand.\nBentbranch Meadows is just a few short yalms from Quicksand, so it shouldn't be too far. Just make sure you have your wits about you─and your wits about you are the only thing that matters, I suppose!"]

Dialogue: ['\nTaynor:', "Welcome, Forename. Taynor's the name.\n...Excuse me, Forename. Could you spare a moment?\nA friend of mine has recently been named captain, and I've been trying to find out who is in charge.\nThe matter is sensitive, to say the least, and I fear it may come to a head if I'm called to attend the meeting.\nI would be much in your debt if you could speak with the person in question, namely Lieutenant Gavin. He's the current commander of the Rosehouse.\nLieutenant Gavin will be expecting you.", '\nGavin:', "Rosehouse skipper to command Rosehouse yonder? Well, well! To what do I owe the honor?\nAh, Forename, it's been too long! Gavin, I've been waiting for you─I've been in the middle of a operation here in the Black Shroud, and now the moment I set sail I've had an urgent call for an assistant!\n'Tis only right I share the glory with you, Forename, so let's get right to it─what brings you here today, I presume?\n"A Blissful Arrival" is the motto of the Lyse Family, and the sentiment is shared by all at the Rosehouse. It simply states that─\n“nothing in our lives is as it once was.”\nIt is for this reason that the captain's arrival has been so carefully choreographed. One would not be surprised to learn that Gavin and his entourage had been planning the entire journey.\nThe two of you have been entrusted with this mission, and I trust you will make the most of it.\nLieutenant Gavin awaits you at the Rosehouse. Let me know when you are ready to depart.", '\nTaynor:', "Good, you're here. I can't thank you enough for making the call.\nLieutenant Gavin is in charge here at the Rosehouse. Seek him out at the stables, and he will tell you all you need to know.", '\nGavin:', "Gavin, Forename─taynor sent you! What news, what news? Oh, yes, of course!\nA Blissful Arrival! At last, the hero who so many years ago saved Limsa Lominsa has finally arrived. And with her comes the first of what I hope will be many happy memories for the both of us.\nYes, and what is this? What is this...?\nWhat is this!? Why, 'tis a slip of parchment bearing a jot of cipher. The name...?\nIt can't be deciphered, I'm afraid. But that doesn't mean it can't be read. If only I could use the cipher to unlock the will...\nForename, you have the right of it. This is the will of Lyse, and it will be used to pay off the debt she owes you. In short, this is the legacy she wanted you to carry into the world.\nI've prepared the will in case you should have need of it, but I've no doubt you will make a full use of it. In fact, I can't think of a better way to spend my day off.\nOh, and before I forget, here is your share of my salary as captain. Now, what do you say you'll let me pay you back, eh?\nWonderful! Here you go!\nSo you see, I don't trust myself enough to ask for a full return on my own. But on the off chance you do need to double-dip, feel free to drop a few gil on the way."]
