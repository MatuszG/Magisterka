Dialogue: ['\nHien:', '\nAh, Forename. You have been waiting for me.\nAs you may have noticed for yourself, we Tholls are blessed with a rather unusual set of horns.\nA number of years ago, a certain nobleman was seen to ride a golden horned beast. The tale goes that he was in fact a Djinn, and that his intent was to woo the ladies of his court.\nOf course, the nobleman's intent was much more sinister than that. He was plotting to seize the horns, and in the process, mutilate the people of his lands.\nBut no one was more alarmed than I, and so I went to seek out the man. I journeyed far and wide, and eventually came upon him in the ruins of Amh Araeng.\nThe man was, in fact, a Djinn, and I was able to catch him red-handed in the act. I then proceeded to tie him up with this prayer which I had fashioned, and with the aid of the wood, he was soon silenced.\nI was in fact a member of the guard when this took place, but the experience left me scarred for life. Ever since, I have been unable to return to my former life.\nI am unsure as to what would have happened had you not come along. I would ask that you seek out the Djinn in question and speak with him, but I do not wish to burden you further.\nIf you should happen to encounter the man in question, pray seek him out and bind him with this prayer. I will see that it is delivered to him as well.', '\nHien:', '\nI thank you for your help.\nI am pleased to report that the Djinn you seek has yet to appear.

Title: A Blissful Arrival
Dialogue: ['\nBertliana:', "\nAh, my dear Forename. I trust you are well rested? Good, because I fear there is yet more to be done.\nI would have you join me in the dining hall. The reason? We are in dire need of a skilled chirurgeon.\nWe are currently shorthanded, as you may have noticed for yourself. The only two of our chirurgeons are presently present─Dr. Leveilleur and Dr. Leveilleur II─and both are indisposed.\nIt has become increasingly difficult to find chirurgeons who are willing to come and assist us, so I am in desperate need of help.\nPlease, would you be willing to accompany me to the dining hall and serve as our new chirurgeon? It would not do to have one of our own go missing.", '\nBertliana:', '\nI would have you accompany me to the dining hall and serve as our new chirurgeon.

You should join us in the hall, too. It will be a long and arduous journey, but we have a purpose.", '\nLeveilleur:', "\nI'm certain the two of us will find a way.

It was a most enlightening experience.\nYou see, we have lost our only two chirurgeons. They were both taken by the Dravanians some time ago.\nThey claim to be possessed of the most amazing abilities. Yet, they refuse to show themselves to us─at least, not in the presence of our loved ones.\nThis situation has put a strain on our relations with the other tribes. We need to find a way to express our gratitude.\nMy heart is full of joy. I can see you are eager to do the same.\nPlease, meet me at the entrance to the Rising Stones and meet my companion, Forename.', '\nBertliana:', '\nThank you, Forename.

He has taken to devouring every word I have said and done.\nAh, yes. In the days ahead, we will be working tirelessly to recreate the perfect banquet for our guests.\nBut before we begin, I must ask you to help us build a stronger foundation. We will need every able-bodied man and woman in the village to help make this a reality.\nThe more the merrier, of course. Come, let us begin!"]
