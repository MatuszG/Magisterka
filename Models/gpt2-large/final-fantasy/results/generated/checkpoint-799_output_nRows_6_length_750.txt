Title: A Bargain Struck
Dialogue: ['\nOstenoe:', '\nHm?

It has now been decided to exchange them for more rare items.\nIn order to do this, however, we need to locate the cave where the hunters found them.\nWe would not be able to do so alone─the Garleans are known to use the caves as secret passageways.\nWe must search for the cave from which they came─the cave where they first found the items.\nThe hunter who first found them must have been able to do so, and they may have taken those items with them.\nWe would go searching for the cave, but it would be a waste of time. There are many other places where the hunters found the items.\nI would be most grateful if you could go and search for the cave, and bring us back any items you find.\nThe hunter who first found the items must have been able to do so, and they may have taken those items with them.', '\nOstenoe:', '\nThank you, hunter. We had hoped to exchange these for even more rare items, but our search has come to an end.\nThe Garleans, on the other hand, may have more valuable things to trade.\nWe do not have much time left, but if you would be so kind as to assist us, we would be more than happy to give them anything you might have.\nThe hunter who first found the items must have been able to do so, and they may have taken those items with them.', '\nOstenoe:', '\nThat is all for now.
