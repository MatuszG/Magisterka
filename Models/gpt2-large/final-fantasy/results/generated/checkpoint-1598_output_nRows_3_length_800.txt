Dialogue: ['\nAlphinaud:', '\nI must confess, the sight of such a wondrous instrument fills me with an almost primal thrill.

You're a man of many talents─and a certain someone who seems to have quite a knack for picking up odd bits of information.\nI've come to a rather unusual realization while pondering over my findings. You see, when I found the instrument, I found a message in a very strange place.\nIt's as if a great evil has been summoned to the moon by some unholy alliance of sin eaters and heretics. I believe that the sin eaters have been brought to the moon by the same entity as we have here on the ground─the imperials.\nAnd with our combined strength, we should be able to drive it off, but it seems to be gathering strength of its own.\nI've been tasked with slaying it, but I fear it has already been summoned. If you could slay it for us, we would all be in your debt.", '\nAlphinaud:', '\nI must confess, I was rather surprised that you were able to slay the sin eater.

I wonder if the moonkin is indeed dead?\nWell, it appears that you've done the right thing. I must thank you for delivering the good news to my people.\nIt's a great shame that we cannot speak of this here on the moon, but I am glad to know that the instrument will not be forgotten.\nI shall have to thank you again in the future, Forename. If there are any other wonders of which you are aware, I am sure I will share them with you."]
