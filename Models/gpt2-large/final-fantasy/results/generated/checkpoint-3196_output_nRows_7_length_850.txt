In this case, the client is concerned with the production of fertilizer, and the means by which such a substance is stored and transported.\nFertilizer is essential to the continued operation of agriculture in Costa del Sol, and maintaining a stable environment for the production of such fuel is a vital aspect of business operations.\nUnfortunately, there is a shortage of such raw materials, meaning that their procurement is increasingly difficult.\nThat's why the Crystarium has entered into a cooperation with the Fuld Bureau, a local firm that specializes in the acquisition of fertilizer.\nFuld's efforts have resulted in a substantial increase in the number of bags that are sent to the Crystarium each year.\nAs a result of such cooperation, the Crystarium has seen a substantial increase in the number of contracts it is able to provide.\nI hope the cooperation continues to serve as an incentive for local business, and as such, I look forward to seeing more of Costa del Sol come to fruition!\nCosta del Sol is Costa del Sol!\nThat's why I'm here: to make your life in Costa del Sol as pleasant as possible.

Dialogue: ['\nSeverian:', '\nA little while ago, a patrol found a sow abandoned on the south side of this isle.\nSaying it was abandoned, they suggested it was abandoned by its owner, who has since moved on to a better place.\nWhile it is true that many a good deed has been undone by the passage of time, this particular sow did not deserve such a cruel fate.\nIt deserves better than to be buried under a mountain of rubble. So I ask you─find this sow, and bury it in the dirt at the foot of the cliff near the patrol's location.\nSaying this will not be as easy as you would like, but I trust in you, Forename. Go, and see the deed done.\nYou will find the sow abandoned on the south side of this isle. Pray bury it there.', '\nSeverian:', '\nYou have already seen to the sow?

I was hoping you might call upon me for assistance.\nYou see, I've been keeping busy preparing our defenses for the coming assault, but I've run into a bit of trouble.\nIn my research, I've come across a rather peculiar weapon─an adamantoise─that seems to have been developed for dragons, but which seems to have been adapted for use against man.\nIt's unclear whether or not they were created as a means to combat the Empire, or if they were simply meant to be used against man, but either way it's clearly been put to use.\nI've sent a researcher to compare the weapons and see if they bear a commonality to them, but I fear I've run into a bit of a dead end.\nWould you be willing to take on a task in which you would have some control over the outcome?\nMy associate arrived with the adamantoise. We need to see if they bear a commonality to them. If you can take it to them in my stead, I think we might be able to learn a thing or two.\nI can't say for certain what they're looking for, but I imagine they're probably examining the blades of their weapons. You can try to sneak up behind them and disarm them, but make sure you do so in a way that doesn't draw attention.", '\nAlphinaud:', '\nMy associate arrived with the adamantoise.

It's not something they want to give up, but they simply can't.\nI'm sorry for asking you to assist, but could you take this in exchange for helping me?\nThank you. It's not much, but I'll make it worth your while.\nI'll take it to my colleague at the Weapons Research and Development Facility.

I take it you've come to collect the adamantoise?\nYes, this is what we were hoping for. Very well. I will prepare the payment as soon as I have it.\nI don't know what you were thinking, but to create a weapon solely for battle is a rather bold move. Especially when you consider the fact that they were created to kill.\nWhile we can't claim to have a unique design, we certainly have a unique design, and this certainly helps us stand out from the crowd.\nI will take this to our colleague at the Weapons Research and Development Facility. He will see you rewarded for your efforts."]

Why did you even bother asking?\nThese bottles are meant to be drunk cold, not drunk hot. You'd never know, but the impurities in the process cause the liquor to sour and burn your throat, causing you to cough and wheeze.\nLuckily, I've a solution to this problem. I'll just dilute the moonshine in a solution I concocted, and pour it over the top of the bottle.\nNow, before you go, I must warn you: this method is liable to burn through your bottle─especially if you're using it as an ingredient for another potion. For best results, pour the solution into a clean container before drinking.\nOh, and if you happen to lose track of where to find the moonshine, you can always ask Cicely. She always has it in her hands.", '\nCicely:', '\nPouring moonshine into empty bottles? Hmmm... I do not know how I would ever feel about that...\nWell, I suppose we have nothing further to discuss.

Hardly surprising that the boy would choose this over the alternative.\nBut we do not speak─what of it? What do we know of him?', '\nCevis:', "\n...So that's the way of it. I suppose there ain't nothin' more I can say.\nWell, I can say as much. I was wrong to ignore that little shite. I owe him my life, and I won't forget that.\n...And I owe you an explanation.\n...What? You're worried about what I'm going to say? I'm not...\n...But you are worried!?

Title: A Brave Resolution
Dialogue: ['\nUrianger:', '\nGreetin's, Forename. Yon bard has a tale takin' up in yer mind, has ye not?\nAye, a brave maiden did meet with a brave knight, an' together they did a deed that even legend could scarce believe.\nA band of outlaws was slayin' men an' women an' children in the name of their leader. When the Warrior of Light caught wind of it, he stood up an' said “Not again.” An' that was the last time I saw ol' Uin' Gunn.\nBut tell me true: did ye ever dreamt ol' Uin' Gunn would come back to life?\nIf it be aye, then I have a tale that might just about satisfy your cravings!\nA band of outlaws was slayin' men an' women an' children in the name of their leader. When the Warrior of Light caught wind of it, he stood up an' said “Not again.” An' that was the last time I saw ol' Uin' Gunn.\nBut tell me true: did ye ever dreamt ol' Uin' Gunn would come back to life?', '\nPop:', '\nYou sense a hostile presence!', '\nAccess:', '\nThe enemy is still about!', '\nPop:', '\nYou sense a hostile presence!', '\nAccess:', '\nThe enemy is still about!', '\nUrianger:', "\nAh, Forename. How fares the tale?\n...Yes, it was a noble endeavor, but I fear it was too little too late.\nThe outlaws are no more. The land has been reclaimed by the people.\nIn fact, I believe this act of bravery has set a new precedent. All adventurers─from our ranks─are to band together in a single, bold resolve to rid Gridania of all who would threaten our way of life.\nAnd I believe that is what you came for. To hear Forename tell it, ye wanted to know if there was truth to this tale?\nSo listen up. I have forged a new alliance, and we will not stand back when the time is ripe─not when our comrades are in danger─to take whatever measures are necessary.\nThis is a new era, and Gridanian an'roids know naught of peace. We must learn to live with each other─if only for the sake of the future.\nBut enough talk. I would give you this as a gift. Take it with good will, Forename. I hope the tales I hear from you and your fellow adventurers inspire you to set new precedents!"]
