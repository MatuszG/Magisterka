Dialogue: ['\nE-Sumi-Yan:', 'Greetings, Forename. I trust you are enjoying your atma–infused relic?\nThough I am unsure as to when exactly you acquired it, I am positive it was not long ago.\nI am also positive you paid a handsome price for it.\nLet us review the transaction, shall we?\nYou received a perfect blend of atma and souls. This fusion of souls is what allows your relic to truly wield its powers.\nThough there is no telling when a new soul will spontaneously appear, it is always a wonderful surprise!\nOf course, not all souls are created equal. Some are born with a particular talent for wielding arcane magicks.\nThese individuals are known as arcane knights.\nWhen they are ready, they are taught their art by their superiors.\nIn return, they receive extensive training in various disciplines.\nOnce a year, they go on excursions to faraway lands to hone their skills.\nThis was your chance to make a name for yourself as an arcane knight. Make no mistake, you must work hard to earn the respect of your peers.\nGood luck, Forename. I look forward to seeing you again.']

It is a blend of high-purity vanadium and low-purity cobalt.\nCompared to other armors, such as steel, it has a relatively low melting point, making it ideal for use in cannons and other weapons that require a relatively high melting point.\nAlthough it is not the most common of metals, cobalt has a number of notable uses, such as in the manufacture of glass and as an ingredient in the creation of steely armor.\nSpeaking of which, just the other day, Ser Bertliana was thinking of how she might try her hand at some traditional Eulmoran armor making. She had a mind to go all the way and─get this─make it herself!\nI'm sorry to put you through all this trouble, but should you decide to give it a try, I would be happy to give you a fitting payment as well!\nI know it sounds like a lot of work, but bear with me.

It would be a shame to send you there without making sure everything is in working order.\nIn short, have your forge ready for the next step─I'll wait here.\nSer Bertliana's lessons can be found at the Ironworks.
