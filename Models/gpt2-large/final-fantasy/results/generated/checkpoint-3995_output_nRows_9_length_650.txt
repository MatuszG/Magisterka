Dialogue: ['\nGildon:', "You...you're a friend of the boy! You must help!\nThe other day, we were out for a stroll and passed a stall run by an Ul'dahn merchant who was selling forbidden scrolls to adventurers. He looked so confident...so commanding... I couldn't help but feel aroused.\nI asked him what was so special about the scrolls, but he just laughed and said it was all a big joke.  Little did I know, that was the very man who had just tempted me!\nNow, you wouldn't be able to buy the forbidden scrolls from the Ul'dahn, but you could still ask for them from the Dravanians.\nYou could make a deal with one of them, and receive a special scroll in return. I know someone who can handle such a transaction. Meet with her, and she'll walk you through the process.\nOh, and before you go asking, I would ask you not to tell anyone about this deal.

Ah, I can't wait to see the look on your face when she hands you the scroll!\nThe Ul'dahn merchant you met was a master of the trades, but he is no more special than any other merchant.\nIf you can't believe someone could be tempted to sell their soul for a scroll, how much more powerful can those forbidden scrolls be?\nI couldn't believe either myself or my friend was able to get our hands on them, but I have to at least try. Do you think you can get a similar scroll for me?", '\nGildon:', "You...you actually got one! It's a miracle!\nI can't believe you were able to get the scroll, but I'm relieved you were able to complete the transaction.\nIf the merchant who sold you the scroll is indeed the same one who tempted me, he could be a dangerous enemy.\nBut enough about them. Let's talk about the boy. What did he want with you?\nHe claims to have fallen in love with you after seeing you with his own eyes. He told me he would commit suicide if

The Azure Dragoon who bestowed upon Gibrillont his commission would no doubt be cross if he saw his comrade in a graveyard dressed in rags.\nAnd so it is fitting that the weapon of our patron saint be found within the Soul of the Warrior, to aid the soul who seeks to emulate his strength.\nNow, before we begin, I must warn you: this isn't going to be like some jaunt in the desert.\nYou'll be pitted against wave after wave of fellow Dravanians, each one more brimming with the selfsame passion you seek to quell your inner beast.\nAnd that's not to mention the hordes of fiends that seek to challenge your might.\nShould any of that frighten you, I ask that you seek refuge within the Soul of the Warrior, to further hone your skills.\nBut let us be clear: this is no mere rite of passage. Rather, it is a trial to test the limits of your chosen instrument.\nOnce you have found your chosen instrument, you will carry it in your hands and use it to call forth the power of the Azure Dragoon.\nSo, what say you? Will you be joining us?\nThen let us be off. Forename, I would ask you to take your weapon to the field.\nImmediately after you retrieve it, pray meet me in the Soul of the Warrior. We shall prepare a ritual tool of the highest order, and you will be no doubt present.", '\nGibrillont:', "Welcome back, Forename.
