He should be able to make the necessary adjustments to the crystal's aether, and voilà─a masterpiece born of pure genius!", '\nZlatan:', '\nGerolt, will you be coming along too?\nAs Gerolt mentioned, we will require some manner of reagent to attune the crystal's aether to the weapon.

Dialogue: ['\nLauriane:', "Ah, Forename. It is good to see you again.\nMy father's memory remains strong, and he has often spoken of you with fondness.\n...But he has been unable to say more than that on account of the risks he runs by speaking out in public.\nThus I have been seeking ways to repay you for your kindness.\nI have sent word to the Holy See of Ishgard. The Holy See is of course in no position to grant us pardons, but we would be much in your debt if you could help us by gathering some items.\nThe items I would have you gather are those which may have been used as food during the Calamity.\nWe have marked on the map where they are to be found.

Did you manage to find anything?\nOh my, this is most excellent. I'm delighted to see that my father's memory has not completely faded.\nAs you know, he spent the intervening years at Reisen Temple. It is said he spent his last years there, that he might finish the work he began.\nBut he left behind a legacy that was truly vast─a legacy which will never be fully appreciated until its fruition.\nI am proud to say that he was a member of the first group to arrive at Reisen.\nHe was the first to arrive in the capital, and the first to arrive in Sharlayan. He was the first to arrive in Rowena's home.\nHe was the first to arrive in the northern wastes, and the first to arrive in the western highlands. His legacy is that of a true Ishgardian, and I'm proud to carry on his work.\n...You see where this is going. We need to continue to honor his memory, and we need to do it soon.\nSo please, hurry and find the items. I would be much in your debt.", '\nLauriane:', 'Thank you, Forename. It is with your help that I am able to continue to fulfill my father's legacy.\n...And yet, I fear there are still some things that need doing before we can say our good-byes.\nFor instance, there is one more thing that I would ask of you before we part ways.\nTo help you on your journey, I would ask that you make a gift of this Shroud to a member of the Order of the Twin Adder.\nI have marked the location of the location where the gift is to be given on the
