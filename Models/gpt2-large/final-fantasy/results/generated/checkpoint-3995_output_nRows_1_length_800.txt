I mean to attract a starry sky full of monsters, of course...\nThe plaza is just one of the many places our tribe has chosen to hold its feasts and festivities. Each is unique, and I'm hoping adventurers like yourself will visit and fill out the blanks!\nFirst things first, we need to discuss how we're going to approach our task. I've laid out the entire plan on my big map─go and see for yourself!", '\nMogoon:', "\nGo ahead and see for yourself. There's a board up on the wall right over there. Don't be a stranger!", '\nMogoon:', "\nThere you are! Well? What did you think of the plan?\nWonderful! The monsters won't be able to see you coming, of course─you'll be blending in so perfectly!\nOf course, we'll need to add a little something to make it look like a proper ceremony! After all, we're going to be marrying these two souls, and if the monsters see our lovebirds fluttering down the streets, well...\nNow, I've laid out the entire plan on my big map, but there's one last thing I need to do before we begin...\nA monster hunter from another tribe passed through here once, and he remembers my favorite place to hunt. If we could somehow find the man, we could recreate the scene he saw, and have the monster-loving folk come and take a picture of us together!", '\nMogoon:', "\nI bet that beast hunter is still in the plaza somewhere. If you can find him, and ask him what he remembers, we can recreate that same plaza for him!", '\nMogoon:', "\nAh, you've returned! I trust the hunt was as fruitful as you claimed?\nWonderful! It's such a relief to finally be able to share the joy of hunting with others.\nAs I've said, each is unique, and I hope adventurers like yourself will visit and fill out the blanks as well!\nNow that we've decided on our strategy, it's time to actually put it into practice. I want to teach you, you see, but I need someone to listen and contribute to the learning!\nIf you could wait here a moment, I'll go and teach you the most important part of our ceremony─the singing!\nCome back later if you'd like to hear more of my tale! Ah, and before you go, if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask me!", '\nMogoon:', "\nSo, what did you think of the plan?\nWonderful! It's a fine balance between traditional and modern, I should think─I'm sure our clients will agree!"]
