If you are up to the task, I would have you escort my friend to the front lines.\nI have already sent word ahead and will await you at the scene of the battle.\nBefore we part ways, I would share with you some useful information that may prove to your benefit.\nThere is a place just outside of the city where there is always a plentiful supply of foodstuffs.

I will stay right here and keep watch.\nAh, you are back. I hope the foodstuffs did not go to waste.\nAh, but where are my manners? After all, I am offering you this very valuable service. Allow me to thank you properly.\nYou see, my friend was wounded while on patrol. While tending to her, she overheard a conversation between two Garleans. The woman was clearly favoring one of the enemy side, but in my heart of hearts I know it to be innocent.\nI cannot help but worry, however. If my friend is caught between the two of them, what will become of her?\nIn any case, I am grateful for your aid. It is only a matter of time before both sides are forced to come to an understanding.\nNow then, let us return to the matter at hand. It has been a while since last we spoke. I hope you have learned something useful from my little speech.\nAs I said before, going into battle is never an easy thing. Even the best of soldiers must come to terms with the fact that they will be killing people day after day.\nThat is why I wanted you to bring me my friend's foodstuffs. Had you not done so, I may have been forced to enlist you in the service of the Eorzean Alliance.\nI realize this is sudden, but I want you to know that I am grateful. Anyroad, I shall see you back at the scene of the battle.", '\nBlaisette:', "\nYou have returned safely. I trust everything went well?\nAh, Forename. I was hoping you would be able to aid my friend again.\nIt seems my worries were unfounded. Not only was she not caught in the crossfire, but she managed to escape with her life.\nThat is why I am so glad to hear that you have taken on the task. It is no easy thing taking on such a responsibility, but you have proven yourself capable thus far.\nIt is one thing to stand on the front lines and carry out one's duties; it is another to take on an entirely new challenge and make a name for oneself by slaying a particular foe.\nEither way, I am grateful for your aid. Here is a little something to show my gratitude."]

I do not doubt that he would be pleased to see you again.\nI know not why, but the other day I found myself beset with a sudden and terrible headache. I had been to see a specialist, but he was so preoccupied with other matters that he never came by. I suspect he may have left the sultanate in search of a more suitable environment.\nI realize now that the only way I can repay the debt I owe to you is to perform for you a sacred task. I would be most honored if you could perform for me the ritual of cleansing the palate.\nTo begin with, I would ask you to take a holy sip of holy water. The purpose of this ritual is to purify the palate, and drinking the water draws out the impurities from the food and drinks we have prepared.\nAfter you have taken the water, I ask that you sprinkle it about the room where the ritual is to be performed. This is to purify all the previous meals and drinks we have prepared.

And I see with clarity now what I meant when I said that the task of forgiveness was most important to me.\nYou see, I believe that the most important lesson for a traveler is that he should not be held accountable for the sins of others. No, he must be held accountable for his own sins.\nI am reminded of the words of the sultana─to look upon the sins of another and do not be moved.\nIn this way, we can learn to look upon those sins with a different eye. We can no longer be blinded by our desires and appetites. We can no longer be so easily drawn to take life.\nI am reminded of another sultan, another warrior who stood against the temptations of the moment and lived to tell the tale. His name is Taharrif, and I am honored to call him friend.\nAh, you are returned. I hope you have learned something of the importance of looking upon sins with a different eye. Please accept this as a small token of my gratitude.']

We have intelligence that the Empire has yet another encampment near the Hume Falls.\nThis would be an ideal time to strike at the heart of their defenses.\nThe problem, however, is that these encampments are not only manned by the Sultansworn, but by a unit loyal to House Durendaire.\nI would have you approach the sentry and distract them while I infiltrate the camp.\nI will leave the details to you, Forename.

I was wrong to have been so certain.\nThis is Doma. The castle was built by the Doman noble family, and its reconstruction was the work of many generations.\nAfter the war, many Doman residents fled to escape the pogroms, but a few who remained behind decided to reclaim their homeland.\nSome of them fought bravely, giving their lives for the Doman cause. Others were simply criminals who sought to make amends by taking up the sword and becoming a samurai.\nWhatever their reasons were, they did not deserve to be put to death by those who claimed to be doing the nation a favor.\nI am proud to have been a part of the Doman resistance, and I would ask any survivors of their struggle to come to our nation.\nIf there are any among them who wish to make amends, we would be honored to accept them.\nThank you for your help. I will tell the others of your bravery, and ask that you be recognized by the Doma people as well.', '\nDoma:', '\nPlease tell the others of your bravery. I will be watching.', '\nGogoshu:', '\nThe prisoners are no longer in Doma? Good. That is good.\nBut there are still imperials about?\nAgain, I was not sure I should have been so certain.\nBut Doma is not a simple place. The Doman resistance fighters fought bravely, giving their lives for our cause.\nEven if they did not make an earnest attempt to reclaim their homeland, they at least tried. I cannot in good conscience allow those who sought to do them harm to go unpunished.\nI will make sure those involved in the incident are made accountable.\nThank you, Forename. You have been a great help to us today. Now we can return to our duties.\nDoma is a proud place, and I would not take it lightly if any part of it were to be lost to the Empire. I will not let that happen.']
