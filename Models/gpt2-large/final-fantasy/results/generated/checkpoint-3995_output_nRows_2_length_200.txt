Dialogue: ['\nUrianger:', '\nThe Eorzean Alliance has struck a deal with the Ixal, establishing a new border post at Eugenia.\nIt is to be a neutral venue for Ixal and Garlean negotiation, and a place where both sides can exercise their right to repel aggression.\nBut while this is a step in the right direction, there is still much to be done before this settlement can truly be called home.\nI sent word to the Scions to solicit their aid, but their leaders said they were none too pleased to be asked to play host to an imperials' warlord. They would not have us commit men to battle, they said.\nThat may be so, but I fear that our reluctance to take up arms may be more than mere sentiment.\nIt may be that our reluctance to take up arms is a matter of principle
