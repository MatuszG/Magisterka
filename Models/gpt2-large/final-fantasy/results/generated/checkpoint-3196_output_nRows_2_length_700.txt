Dialogue: ['\nAlphinaud:', '\n...A bargain struck, perhaps? I shall have to thank Tataru for her counsel.\nLet us speak of the task before us.\nI trust you are aware that the Crystal Braves were charged with retrieving corrupted crystals from the depths.\nAccording to our records, twelve such crystals were recovered.\nThough I suppose it would be premature to draw conclusions until all the crystals have been tested and found to their satisfaction.\nLet us proceed, then, to the task at hand.\nI would have you escort Alphinaud and Y'shtola to the northeast corner of this isle. There you will find the corrupted crystals. Alphinaud should remain behind to await further instructions.', '\nAlphinaud:', '\nThe corrupted crystals? I knew I should have been there!\nTataru has been exceedingly busy of late, but I take it she has managed to track down all the crystals?\nShe has my deepest gratitude.\nAs I said, the Crystal Braves were charged with recovering the crystals.\nWhile I am glad that all the crystals have been found, I am still concerned by the loss of these twelve.\nIf we are to prevent the awakening of the primal, we must have as much of the crystal as possible.\nThough we have made great strides in our struggle, there is still much to be done if we are to seal the primal.\nLet us not waste time, Forename. Go and retrieve as much of the crystal as you can.', '\nTataru:', '\nMy thanks, Alphinaud. I will leave you to your work.', '\nYda:', '\nHm? So the Crystal Braves have managed to recover all the crystals?\nThen it is settled.\nI shall return to Wright and inform Tataru of this success.\nThough, I suppose, it would be remiss of us to celebrate without speaking with you first.\nYour services are required in another matter, Forename. In order to ascertain the true nature of the primals, I have been asked to consult with the Scions.\nThey are currently in Ul'dah, conducting research into the primals. Should you become privy to information which pertains to their findings, you will of course be informed.']

Dialogue: ['\nUrianger:', "\nIt would seem you have the ear of Master Garlond. Very well, I bid you welcome to the Bismarck.\nNow, before we can welcome you aboard, I must needs gauge your aptitude for the role. I require you undertake a trial to test your mettle.\nI would have you travel to Forgotten Springs, where you will be pitted against a man naught more than your own preconceptions.\nYou will face a man who has escaped death more times than I can count; a man who has possessed a blade sharper than the Serpents' fangs; a man who has walked the path to the Gates of Judgement countless times without ever once looking back.\nYou will face this man, and I expect you to lay waste to his soul and body alike.\nThe man you seek is a man called Haurchefant. Haurchefant is a merchant who has made a name for himself in Ishgard as a tireless contributor to the advancement of the realm.\nHe is also, somewhat ironically, one of the greatest black marketseers in Limsa Lominsa.\nIf Master Garlond had known of Haurchefant's nefarious activities, he would have never entreated you to take up this challenge.\nBut forgive me. I have spent too long on this story to drag you away from your task. Come, let us return to the wharf.", '\nPop:', '\nYou sense a hostile presence!', '\nAccess:', '\nThe enemy is still about!', '\nCid:', '\nI see... Well done, Forename. Well done indeed.\nHaurchefant is a black marketeer not only in Limsa Lominsa, but throughout the realm. His role as a conduit for goods across borders allows him to evade the purse while providing for the war effort.\nIt would be in our best interests to eliminate his activities. I shall have to seek him out in the field again.']
