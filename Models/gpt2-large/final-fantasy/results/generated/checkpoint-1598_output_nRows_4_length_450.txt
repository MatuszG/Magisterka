I was afraid I had made a grave error in trusting you with such a task.\nYou see, in my duties as head of House Dzemael, I was told to keep a close eye on all shipments bound for House Dzemael. And I was right.\nThe supplies in the crates I marked for you were meant for House Dzemael, but I have no doubt that House Dzemael is behind this.\nHouse Dzemael has long been a bastion of Dravanian resistance, and this is yet another attempt to split us apart. I fear this will only make things worse.\nIf you are willing to help, I would be much obliged if you could bring me the crates. I will mark them for you on your map.", '\nAlys:', "\nThank you for bringing the supplies I marked for you to House Dzemael.
