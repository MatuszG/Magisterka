It involves a pair of highly trained magitek suits, but only one of them is operational.\nI have a plan, and it's one that I would rather keep secret from outsiders.\nThe suit you are about to see is the prototype for one of my latest innovations─the magitek plasma cannon. It fires a powerful lightning bolt that can cleave a wide area in half.\nI was hoping you might test it out for me, but I am afraid I must needs keep it a secret.
