I've heard the tales, but never seen one of your kind around here.\nIn case you're curious about the origins of your weapon, I'll explain. When your people first settled here, they were forced to abandon their homes and travel to the surface in search of greater opportunity.\nSo it was decided that those who had the means to make it to the surface should begin making weapons from the metals they scavenged.\nWhen you think of the metals you've collected, there's a certain smell that catches your attention. I know what you're thinking─what's the point in collecting anything that doesn't matter?", '\nBenedict:', "The point is that it matters to the end user. If you can bring an end to one of those blasted beasts, you've earned your keep.\nYou have my thanks, friend.\nAs you can see, I've placed a lot of stock in this weapon. It's a shame that so few of our citizens even bother to work metal.\nStill, it's hard to say what effect the weapon will have on the surrounding environment. You can't say for certain what effects it'll have on the people in the settlement.\nBut one thing's for certain─I'll be sure to collect my payment on time.\nAh, and before I forget, I'd like your help once again. I need you to collect four different metals for me.\nWhen you've gathered the metals, return to me and I'll see what I can do for you."]
