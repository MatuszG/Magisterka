The beast is so large and so aggressive that he is presently at the mercy of those less scrupulous than himself.\nIn order to rid the hive of the wasps, he has devised a plan of his own, and it involves entrapping the pests in combs of wax. As they feast on the carrion, he will be able to collect a bounty of honey.\nUnfortunately, the plan has been fraught with peril. For one thing, the wasps have proven to be rather difficult to trap and place in combs of wax. For another, the wasps themselves are extremely aggressive, and any attempt to subdue them invariably results in a frenzy of violence.\nI would ask you to help J'nairoh in his endeavor, but as you know, we are all so busy with our own tasks that we have none to spare for a man of his abilities.
