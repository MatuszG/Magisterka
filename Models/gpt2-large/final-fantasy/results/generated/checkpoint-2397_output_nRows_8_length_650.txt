We adventurers have long sought a respite from the travails of adventuring, and with good reason: adventuring is grueling work, and it takes a certain sort of person to make it all the way from start to finish.\nIn order to make a living as an adventurer, you must constantly battle the fiercest foes, brave the harshest environments, and woo the most beautiful women. None of this is to be taken for granted, of course, and the pursuit of happiness is not an exclusively male endeavor.\nSo when you think of the hardships you must overcome on a daily basis, it's easy to feel a sense of hopelessness. But worry not─I have a solution that should brighten your spirits and put you on the path to greater achievement.\nI speak of a new─and rather unique─veil that I recently designed for my female patrons.\nIn accordance with the wishes of my female patrons, I have designed a new headwear that is both practical and fashionable.\nThe fabric is a blend of cotton, silk, and cotton cloth, and is intended to provide protection from the elements─think of it as a layer of modesty that is both breathable and impervious to the elements.\nAt the same time, it is extremely lightweight, making it ideal for layering and layering, making it perfect for layering and layering. And it is all thanks to the fine art of layering!\nI am pleased to say that my garments will be available for purchase at the Quicksand in Thanalan, as well as at my other stores in Ul'dah and Ul'dah proper.\nI am also pleased to say that my garments will be available for inspection upon arrival, so if you have a moment to spare, I would be most grateful if you could take a look before placing your order.", '\nGiott:', "\nYou've been incredibly kind, and I am grateful for that.
