I have a rather curious encounter that I would entrust to a capable adventurer.\nMy encounter took place in Lakeland, but I fear I am not suited to the frigid climes. Thus, I would like to make a stop at Camp Skull Valley.\nThere is something I would ask of you. See this stick up in the air over there? It is an Allagan relic. I want you to retrieve it for me.\nPlease, hurry. I cannot wait another moment!', '\nDrest:', '\nI am searching for an Allagan relic. Please, retrieve it for me.', '\nDrest:', '\nAh, you are back. I had been waiting for you. Please, tell me everything that happened.\nOh my, this is an artifact from before the war! I must thank the Garleans for keeping it.\nAfter the fall of Ronka, the Crystal Exarch sent his comrade to collect the crystals. They then went on to found the Monetarists' Guild.\nIt was their work that gave rise to the Scholarly Alliance, and its members created the Allagan Empire.\nIt is thanks to them that I am able to remember the past. Without their help, I doubt I would have made it back here.\nWhen I heard about the archaeologist's discovery, I was so excited I nearly lost my mind. It is thanks to them that I am able to carry on my research.\nIf I should have children, I would like them to know of my research. It would also give them an idea of what it means to do what I do.\nI will continue my research at the Crystarium. Please wait for me there so that I might continue my talks with Drest.']

Dialogue: ['\nSeverian:', "\nGood evening, milord. I trust you are enjoying your holiday? If so, perhaps you would consider lending me a hand?\nI require the aid of a veteran adventurer─someone who has faced their fair share of danger─to procure a certain item.\nI would be most grateful if you could retrieve it for me.\nThe item in question is a unique fusion of crystal and metal created by Thaumaturges of the Twelveswood. Used in their magicks to enhance the strength of their allies, the crystals are extremely valuable.\nUnfortunately, I lost my chance to purchase a proper sample when I was first approached by a goblin merchant. He was looking for someone to bring him some for his upcoming endeavor.\nI remember that day very clearly. I was too young to understand the risks, but I was too stubborn to back out. I soldiered on, hoping that the merchant would change his mind. He did, eventually, but only after I paid him a great price for the privilege.\nI finally managed to track down the merchant, only to find out later that he had sold me my soul to the beastman for the bargain.\nI would never forgive myself if I had been less patient with the merchant. I would make it my mission to retrieve the crystals from Thaumaturges of the Twelveswood and return them to him.\nBut I cannot do it alone. I need your help once more, milord.

Dialogue: ['\nEilis:', '\nI must confess, my curiosity was piqued by the peculiar weapon you recovered. A weapon more than a mere tool, if you will...\nA weapon with which to kill...by which to kill. A weapon refined to perfection, if you will. A weapon whose core is the soul of a living being.\nAnd it is precisely for this reason─as a weapon─that I have made every effort to procure a more ancient specimen.\nYet I fear that my inquiries have been met with disdain. As if the very notion of possessing such a relic somehow makes you a heretic.\n...Ah, but forgive me. I was merely curious. I am not in the business of destroying life.\nIt is not my place to judge the actions of others. What I can say is that as a fellow enthusiast, I am eager to learn more of this relic. And so I turn to you once again.\nIf you have a moment, I would hear of the events that led to its discovery. You will not need to travel to Amh Araeng to learn of this, as I have already relayed the information I received from my collaborators.\nIt was during one of our research expeditions that we stumbled upon these ancient artifacts. The more we looked at them, the more we saw the likeness of a living being.\nSome of the local tribes claim to have these souls in their cores, and it is believed that these shards are the property of the first Eilis─the first to wield such a weapon.\nThe question is, how did this being end up in a forgotten corner of Amh Araeng? It is not easy to say, but I think it may be that the heretics sought to destroy it, using some manner of ritual.\nThe more we learned about these ancient weapons, the more we realized that they are far more than tools. They are, in fact, the embodiment of a being, the very soul of the first Eilis.\nWe have come to regard these tools as holy, and it is for this reason that we have decided to preserve and study them. It is our hope that one day, when the heretics are no more, these relics will be presented to their rightful owner.\nThat day─should it ever come─will not
