Title: A Bargain Struck
Dialogue: ['\nHidetaka:', "\nHow fares your hunt for the legendary beasts, Forename?\nI'm sure you've had your share of success, but it's time you took your skills to another level.\nI've an idea─a game of tag. You need to tag as many of the creatures as you can─be it the same creatures or different ones─and get them to attack each other.\nThe beasts are called 'the brawns, and they've been found to be capable of attacking other creatures.\nI reckon you'd be able to find a decent number of the creatures by hunting them down.\nAnd it's not like you're going to die. I'll tell you what, you can have as many of the creatures as you want to go after!\nOh, and if you want to try your hand at tag, don't worry─I'll give you a chance. The next time I have an opportunity to try it, I'm sure you'll get it.", '\nHidetaka:', '\nI'm sure you've had your share of success, but it's time you took your skills to another level.

I'll get right to it!', '\nHidetaka:', "\nYou've done great work, Forename. I'll take this as a reward for your efforts.\nThis is all thanks to you, Forename. I owe you a great deal.\nI'm sure you've noticed, but we are a species of beasts. We are a race, and we are one of the most intelligent creatures in the world.\nBut it was our race that first brought about the Flood. And now, as we continue to evolve, we must evolve further.\nWe must evolve to become one with nature. This is why I ask that you help us. You are a warrior, and I am a warrior─and I need your help.\nYou see, there is a young girl. She has an interest in nature.\nWhen she first asked for help, she was unsure what to do.\nBut then I explained it to her. And she was inspired.\nShe said to herself, 'I will change the world!', '\nHidetaka:', '\nYou have my thanks, Forename. I would ask that you help her with her studies.\nI have a theory that she would be able to help us if she were to join us.\nBut there is no time. The young girl is in need of help now, and I would ask that you help her now.', '\nHidetaka:', '\nI'm sure you've had your share of success, but it's time you took your skills to another level.
