I agreed to trade him some Bolts for a consignment of goods.\nHowever, upon inspection, I discovered that the shipment contained no Bolts at all.

At this point I became extremely frightened, and thought to flee.\nHowever, I am not a coward. I told him that I would not flee─I would kill him if need be. He then agreed to meet me in Costa del Sol.\nI apologize for making you “appear to be a coward,” but I cannot in good conscience go with him. Please give him the Bolts I gave you.

Dialogue: ['\nBomott:', "\nAh, Forename. I've been awaiting your return. Word of your triumph in the Coliseum has already reached me.\nNot only has your victory earned you a place in the annals of Elpis history, but it has also lifted my spirits.\nI must say, it's been quite a while since I've been this fired up. Ever since your trouncing of Titan, I've been unable to concentrate on anything else.\nBut now that I've had a chance to soak it in, I believe I can share some of the knowledge I've gleaned with you.\nAs you've undoubtedly noticed, our warriors of the realm are in an ever-present state of exhaustion. This has a direct bearing on your fight against Titan.\nAs a result, they've begun to lose their edge. And as fatigue sets in, so too does co-ordination. It becomes difficult to focus, and as a result, soldiers become less effective.\nBut what if we could take some small measure to revitalize them?

They were armed to the teeth, and seemed to be in great demand as a security measure.\nI asked them if they were looking to commit suicide. They said no, but I doubt they meant for it to be an easy thing to say.\nAfter a bit of asking around, I learned that they were actually attempting to commit suicide by imbuing themselves with a potion that would slowly kill them.\nI could see why they would want to end their own life, but to do so in a secluded corner of the Graveyard? I cannot. I must go and help them!\nI will wait here until you arrive. Do you not have somewhere to be? Oh, thank goodness. I will head straight back to where I was.\nI apologize for asking you to wait on me, but could you go and help these burly fellows?

I trust you are enjoying your atma–infused relic?\nAs a matter of fact, I have an idea for improving the relic, and would like your help in gathering more resources.\nBefore I can accomplish this task, however, I must receive the necessary materials from the field─materials which must be destroyed in order to procure them.\nSome of these materials are found in the ruins of Nabaath Areng.
