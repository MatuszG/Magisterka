Whatever the cause, it is likely that Llymlaen's power affected the creature.\nAs a member of the Dravanian Resistance, it is my duty to go into the dungeon and investigate the matter.

Title: A Brave Resolution
Dialogue: ['\nGerolt:', "Made it back in one piece, eh, Forename? Same goes for Misija, 'cept she's taken a nasty knock to the head. 'Course, she's just been released from her─ What's a─ahem...a labor camp.\nThe camp's up in arms over the fact their prisoner of war hero was honorably discharged, not least because they lost a great man to a roadside bomb.\nThe camp's leader, a man named Kopp, insists the hero saved his fellow soldiers' lives by dousing the bomb.\nKopp's a little too proud a man to believe it, though. Calls the whole thing a farce. But I can tell you Gerolt's heard the truth, and that's enough for him.\nSo, what do you say?", '\nGerolt:', 'I...I believe you.', '\nKopp:', "We'll never have peace if the imperials keep nicking our men's memories!\nNow, listen. We're not fools. We know the price of victory─and we know the price of defeat─but what we lack is conviction.\nWe can't be sure what the Allied forces did to earn their victory. But if we're to believe the Garleans did it, we should at least know why they did it.", '\nKopp:', "If we're to believe the Garleans did it, we should at least know why they did it.", '\nGerolt:', 'But...but we haven't─and never will─know the full truth.\nIf you mean to continue down this road, you'll have to prove you can hold your own. And by that, I mean you have to prove you can fight your way back from the imperials.\nYou've heard me harp on about the importance of proving yourself.', '\nKopp:', "Fine, but you'll have to do it the hard way. You'll fight the imperials one battle at a time.\nIn the meantime, I'll keep you busy practicing your hand-to-hand combat. Don't worry about me.\nWhen you're ready, come find me. I'll teach you some of the techniques I used to win the Crozier.\nAnd I'll leave everything else to you. We'll meet again when next you're ready."]

Dialogue: ['\nHugubert:', '\nThe Council of Eld is charged with negotiating the terms of the peace agreement between the Houses of Ul'dah and the Order of the Twin Adder.\nThis is a difficult task, to say the least. Ul'dah is a nation torn by civil war, and each house has its own way of looking at the situation.\nTo complicate matters, the Holy See has asked that each house submit a report to their respective houses detailing their assessments of the situation.\nThis is a daunting task, but our representatives have the benefit of decades of military experience. Should they be unable to agree on a single report, we shall use our considerable diplomatic skill to work out a compromise.\nI would like you to fetch the reports from our two houses. Present them to Franchemont at the Gates of Judgement, and he shall brief you on the particulars of the negotiations.', '\nFranchemont:', '\nHm? Do you have business with me?\nAh, reports from our two houses. I have no doubt that we can come to a mutually agreeable understanding.\nHm? What are they saying?\n...That Ul'dah is at peace? That House Durendaire thinks so too? I can only assume that their representative has been tasked with bringing these reports to their respective Houses.\nIf you are unaware of the situation, allow me to educate you. Ul'dah and Durendaire are not yet united. The Holy See was created to unify the nation after the Calamity, but it is only recently that they have begun to tackle the thorniest of problems.\nDomans are still scarce in number, and their resistance to immigration makes them a hindrance in trade. Ul'dah is eager to attract more adventurers and craftsmen, but they are wary of associating with anyone they consider heretics.\nUl'dah is also loath to engage in any military action without the express permission of the Holy See.\nAs the representative of House Durendaire, it is my responsibility to bring these reports to their attention. I would be grateful if you could fetch them for me.', '\nHugubert:', '\nThe Holy See is currently negotiating the terms of the peace agreement between the Houses of Ul'dah and the Order of the Twin Adder. I ask that you fetch the reports from our two houses. Present them to Franchemont at the Gates of Judgement, and he shall brief you on the particulars of the negotiations.']

Dialogue: ['\nGiott:', "\nWell, this is a rather unexpected development. I expected you'd be interested in hearing about our efforts to rescue our allies from the Garleans.\nBut I never expected you'd be here!\nWe've had a difficult time gathering the required troops to take the field, you see, and I was hoping you might lend a hand.\nI've drafted a resolution that calls for the Alliance to establish a new base of operations in North Shroud.\nOnce the formalities are finalised, we'll deliver it to the Alliance's member nations, requesting their support for the endeavor.\nI'd like you to deliver the resolution to your home nation's envoy. Make your way to the Hall of Flames in central Thanalan and speak with the representative of your choice.\nAnd if you happen to have a few moments to spare, I'd be ever so grateful if you could also collect a few of the Alliance's flags.

I trust you had a pleasant experience?\nThank goodness. Our members are a proud and valiant lot. It's a shame that some of them choose to play at being heroes rather than soldiers.\nBut I'm confident that if we can convince enough of them that heroism is just as valuable as any other quality, they'll come around.\nAnd I'm confident we can do it if we put our lives on the line for them. I just need you to do the same. I'm counting on you."]
