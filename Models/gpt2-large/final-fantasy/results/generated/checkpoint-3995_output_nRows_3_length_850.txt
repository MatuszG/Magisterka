After your successful meeting with the Alliance leaders, you have earned the respect of all at the White Rams.\nThe Eorzean Alliance has agreed to establish a new airship route across the world. This route, if completed, will greatly expand the Garlean Empire's military capabilities.\nAt the moment, however, only a handful of merchants are willing to fly the imperial standard.\nBut I am certain that once the new airship is complete, more and more merchants will flock to its gates, fulfilling the demand for Garlean weaponry and allowing the White Rams to fulfill our part of the bargain.\nIt is my hope that you will be able to help the new airship make its maiden flight.\nIt will be an honor and a privilege to meet you, Forename. I hope the experience will be worth your while.\nI should remind you that the new airship will be fully armed and armored, making it an ideal choice for conducting military patrols or carrying out routine courier duties.\nI should also mention that while the Garlean Empire will be the first nation to fly the new airship, we will not be the last. The Eorzean Alliance will work with other nations to develop an airship service across the realm.\nOnce the new airship is complete, I hope you will visit us again and continue your work for the Alliance."]

Dialogue: ['\nCibleroit:', '\nA deal struck, all right─but not between Eorzea and the Scions.\nThe Ironworks of Ishgard is to be jointly owned and managed by the three great nations of Eorzea: the Empire, the Holy See, and the Greensward.\nUnder the terms of the agreement, the Holy See has the exclusive right to explore, develop, and manufacture military equipment in Eorzea.\nThe Greensward, however, has a different agenda. They wish to retain exclusive rights to minerals from the Isles of Umbra, and have thus sought to negotiate directly with the Syndicate of Cartel Resellers.\nThe Ironworks, however, cannot in good conscience consent to the use of their facilities by the Greensward, whom they consider to be an enemy.\nBut I am afraid that will not be necessary. Under the terms of the agreement, the Syndicate will take custody of all technology and resources collected by the Ironworks and turn them over to the three nations.\nIn exchange for these exclusive rights, the three nations have promised to provide the Ironworks with technical assistance in exchange for their cooperation.\nYou may be surprised to learn that not all of the technology to be exchanged will be of an military nature. Some will be used for non-military purposes.\nWhat you may not know is that these technical assistance provisions were included in the original agreement between Eorzea and the Syndicate of Cartel Resellers.\nThe High Houses of Ishgard and the Holy See have long held a grudge against the Garleans. They see the Empire as an enemy and have been reluctant to entrust their defense with anyone but their own.\nBut the recent developments in Ishgard have changed all that. The Holy See and the Empire now see the Isles of Umbra not only as a potential ally in the war against the Empire, but as a potential partner in the peacekeeping efforts.\nThese provisions, of course, are subject to change at the will of the High Houses. In fact, I doubt it would be unwise to involve the High Houses in the running of the Ironworks themselves.\nSo long as the provisions in the agreement are obeyed, the agreement will stand. And so long as the High Houses are honest and forthright in fulfilling their part of the bargain, I am confident that the agreement will stand.\nSo you see, there is no end to the potential of the Isles of Umbra. Should you wish to learn more about the agreement and the resources to be exchanged, you might refer to the file at the archives in Ul'dah.\nThe file is accessible via the link at the top of this page.", '\nPop:', '\nYou sense a hostile presence!', '\nAccess:', '\nThe enemy is still about!', '\nCibleroit:', '\nWelcome back.

There is much work to be done.', '\nSorashs Koal:', '\nYou have my thanks, my friend. The instrument has granted you both the strength to carry on, and the courage to face your trials.\nI must say, the sight of you both in such fine fettle has made me realize just how precious the life of a woodpecker truly is.\nShould we both have the opportunity to make a living as carpenters, it would not do for us to squander it.\nThat is why I would ask you to play the role of performer for the evening. This will allow us both to share in the wealth of our arts, and afford us the opportunity to hone our skills further.\nNow then─it is time I resumed my studies of the wood.\nStudy, practice, and make new connections! That is the long and the short of it.\nThis has been a busy week for me, and I am grateful to have had the opportunity to meet with such a reliable friend as you. If there is any skill you wish to hone, come and find me when you are ready to begin."]

As Lord Portelaine of House Durendaire, it is my responsibility to oversee the construction of all holy instruments in the Holy See. The Dravanian Hymns, for example, were not only commissioned by the Holy See, but also designed by famed Ishgardian architect Rubh'an. However, according to recent reports, the Holy See has yet to approve the final design for the harp. I would be most grateful if you could bring me a copy of the document containing the objection.

But now that the Crystal Exarch has blessed our holy instruments with his divine touch, it is time for us to take up our new instruments anew. The Hymns were created to guide souls to the next life─not to simply satisfy our whims, but to inspire hope and courage. In fact, the harp you seek is the final piece of our new collection. It was last seen in use during the coronation of our lord Portelaine. But never should we forsake our ancestors, Forename.', '\nEluned:', 'When you bring me the harp I seek, I will be praying for your victory.

Title: A Blessed Instrument
Dialogue: ['\nWichard:', "\nAh, Forename! I've just received word from Master Arvide. He bids you come to the Sunsilk Tapestries in Revenant's Toll for a performance of The Nutcracker.\nYou've heard of the Nutcracker, I trust? The tale goes that the dragon-loving Dravanians of the north have constructed a vast instrument of sorts─a sort that can bestow blessings upon its owner.\nThe poor soul playing the part of saint was once a child of the Dravanian Horde, you see─forced to flee his home in the wake of the Calamity. Upon arriving in Revenant's Toll, he was met with open hostility, and had no choice but to give up the role.\nBut the Dravanians have not forgotten their old friend, nor their gratitude for his service. Master Arvide has been quick to grant him permission to perform at the tavern.\nAnd now that he's here, I've a mind to ask him a question... Would you be so kind as to take this holy water and sprinkle the Nutcracker in it?\nI'm sorry to impose, but would you be so kind as to sprinkle the holy water in the Nutcracker for me? I can't very well ask you to do this on my behalf, of course, but...well, it's the least you could do!\nYou will be asked to sprinkle holy water in the Nutcracker at your leisure. Pray attend me, and sprinkle the holy water as I ask!", '\nArvide:', "\nAh, Forename! You've come at a good time, my friend! Let us discuss the performance at the tavern, shall we?\nWell, the audience is all but guaranteed, so there is no need to rush in granting permission.\nI imagine you have no need to speak with me again until after the performance. I would be most appreciative if you could keep an eye on my performance from time to time, as well.\nI'm quite impressed with your rendition of the song! I can see why Master Arvide deemed you worthy of a place of honor within these halls.\nThere is one more thing I would ask of you, Forename. Would you be so kind as to sprinkle this holy water in the Nutcracker for me? Pray attend me, and sprinkle the holy water as I ask!", '\nArvide:', '\nWell? Did you sprinkle the holy water in the Nutcracker? Pray attend me, and sprinkle the holy water as I ask!', '\nWichard:', "\nOho, what a sight! I'm not sure what I expected, but I daresay it's more than I ever dared hope!\nI'm honored to have been granted permission to perform at the Sunsilk Tapestries. Here is your payment for the job, as promised.\nI must say, I was rather impressed with your rendition of the Nutcracker. It is a stirring piece, and one of Master Arvide's finest.\nI've heard that the Dravanians of the north have constructed an instrument of sorts─a sort that can bestow blessings upon its owner. The poor soul you portray is said to be one of the finest craftsmen in all of Revenant's Toll.\nIf Master Arvide is truly able to grant blessings through this instrument, then we should have no trouble making our own similar gifts to honored patrons.\nOh, and before I forget─your performance was a smashing success! I can see why Master Arvide was so moved by it.\nWell, I must see to preparing our own gifts for the saint. You have my thanks, Forename!"]

One day, I just wanted to find a way to express that power to others─to have some sort of ritual that would bring us together, pray say.\nSo, I asked some of our fellows what manner of music might be suitable. The answer? Why, a prayer tool!\nSo, now that you know what sort of music is appropriate, why don't you go and find one that suits you?\nIf you have an hour, pray pray meet me at the Crystarium.
