A delivery of fresh oranges arrived just now─from a trader who's agreed to pay top gil for them.\nI'm sure he's not the first. Mogret is one of the most respected merchants in all of Thanalan, so this is sure to bring him a great deal of attention.\nStill, it's nice to see Mogret back. I hope his business continues to grow.\nI was all set to send a dozen oranges myself, but... Well, you see, I've been told that some Ul'dahn adventurers have been spotted carrying sacks full of them.\nAs you know, we Ul'dahns pride ourselves on our merchant presence, and this has put a strain on the food supplies. I fear they've been sneaking in to steal our best produce─and that's where you come in. If you take down a few of them, we won't have to worry about this for a while."]

Dialogue: ['\nJantellot:', "\nMy thanks for delivering the supplies, Forename. It's been a pleasure to work with you, and we've had some very promising leads in the investigation.\nBut I must say that our most recent inquiries have come up empty. The bees have yet to appear, and the only sightings we've had thus far have been of the foul-smelling creatures hatching from the nests.\nIt would seem that the hive's been suffering a most terrible loss.\nI suggest you take a look around─you'll find a number of dead bees in the area, along with a number of wounded bees.
