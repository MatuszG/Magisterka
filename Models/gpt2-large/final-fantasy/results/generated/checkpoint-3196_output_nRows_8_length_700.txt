It sounds like both boys are in for a rough time.\nIf I'm to be honest, I was hoping you'd say no more of that to them. I think they need a good beating up before they're ready to take on the task of protecting Camp Skull Valley.\nBut, if you're so inclined, feel free to give them a piece of your mind. I doubt they'll put it to words─after all, they're only children."]

I'm afraid I cannot even give you the nectar. But please, give the letter to the fellow. I'm sure he'll reward you for your trouble.", '\nPoisoned Beekeeper:', "\nThank you, sir. I will take the flowers to the merchant right away.\nYou must be wondering why I would aid a stranger. I'm not sure if the merchant has seen aught to worry about.

Dialogue: ['\nWandering Minstrel:', "\nWelcome back, friend! It is good to see you again. I have a treat for you.\nI would share with you a story, but as you are not a member of the Order, I fear you will not be heard.\nLong ago, in exchange for a gift, a great bard bade me play the bard's favorite instrument─the harp.\nTo this day, I carry it with me wherever I go. But as you are not a member of the Order, I fear you will not be able to hear it.\nIt is said that when the bard was young, he lost his mother, and in her stead he raised a stringed instrument. In time, it became his favorite.\nAlas, the bard did not have long to live. When he was old, the harp he once loved was taken from him by the Gnath.\nWhile it is not easy to understand why the Gnath would want to destroy it, they have taken from something that is dear to us all. I wonder if we will ever be able to make amends for this tragedy.\nIn the meantime, we must look to other ways to express our gratitude. We must preserve the harp so that future generations can hear it.\nPlease see that it is passed on to as many people as you can. I wish I could give more, but as I have said, it is not possible. Please accept this as a small token of our gratitude."]

You look like a fine warrior, if I do say so myself.\nYou see, I was looking around an abandoned house and came across a journal. It was filled with the most amazing stories of adventurers and soldiers from all across the realm.\nOne of the articles even described a hero who felled a hundred dragons with his bare hands. I couldn't believe it! I thought the author had made a complete fabric of the tale!\nThe only problem I had was that I had no idea where the author had gotten his information. I mean, if you're going to write about an amazing hero, you'd best be sure to write about him. So I set about searching for him, but I soon grew weary of the endless bickering.\nThen, one day, I thought to myself, “If only I had been born a few years earlier, when the dragons were fewer, I would have been able to learn all of these amazing tales, and have them engraved on my memory.”\nSo I decided to start a journal, just like the one in the old house. And, as I've continued to write, I've kept finding more and more stories. I think I might be able to put together a package that will bring back the glory days of old.\nPlease, if you find any of these stories interesting, please share them with me!

You will do what must be done.\nYou may be a young serpent, but you have proven far more than a simple pet. You are the keeper of the entwined serpents, yes?\nVery well. The task before you is to catch three of the creatures in the Coerthas central highlands.\nOnce you have accomplished this task, return to me. I will evaluate your performance and make adjustments as necessary.\nBe warned, however─the creatures are extremely dangerous. Care should be taken when attempting to entwine them.\n', '\nKeeper of the Entwined Serpents:', '\nHow fare you?', '\nKeeper of the Entwined Serpents:', '\nExcellent. I knew I was right to entwine these serpents in the first place.\nYou are doubtless wondering why I would entwine these creatures in the first place. I would answer that question, but it is not likely to be of great interest to a mere mortal such as you.\nWhile they serve a useful purpose in feeding, they are far too precious to be kept as mere pets.\nEven so, they are invaluable to our society as a whole. We must be careful not to destroy them in our quest to fill bellies.\nThe Entwined Serpents are one such species. While not as ferocious as the Coerthas brypes, they are nevertheless formidable combatants.\nShould you wish to acquire additional specimens, I would be at your disposal. I would be ever so grateful if you could deliver them to Mistress Serendipity. She has charge of the collection facility in Gridania.', '\nSerendipity:', '\nWelcome, my dear serpent. I take it you have already completed the task?\nWonderful! I will put your efforts into making more.\nThese are marvelous specimens. The texture, the form─everything is exquisite!\nI am pleased to say that I have acquired more of the Entwined Serpents than I could ever hope to obtain by myself.\nI have a great many more to display, but these three are enough for now. I will add them to the pile shortly.\nThere is much I would have you learn about them, but I have precious little time left. If you would like to hear more, I would be at your disposal for further instruction.']

I require your help!\nYou see, my brother and sister are quite skilled in battle, but they are rather slow to develop.\nWhile they do have their uses, they're rather slow to learn new techniques. I would like them to practice on unfamiliar targets for a change!\nThe area around our village is filled with wild beasts, so I need you to slay three of them. Please be careful─they can be feisty little things.', '\nFaucertaux:', '\nPlease, do your best to slay three of the wild beasts.

I could see a great deal of improvement if they were to practice on more familiar foes.\nThough I suppose it's only a matter of time before they are sent out on tasks of a more military nature.

Your valiant efforts on behalf of Gridania have brought us one step closer to achieving our shared objective!\nThough the path forward may be fraught with peril, I cannot deny the sense of accomplishment that comes from seeing our efforts to fruition!\nOur victory may not count for much in practical terms, but it is a tremendous victory for our cause. We have set a new precedent for cooperation between nations.\nIt would not be prudent to leave any aspect of our cooperation to chance. It would be better for our budding cooperation to be put to the test.\nFor this purpose, I have prepared three tasks for you.\nThe first, “Travel to Ul'dah,” is an essential step in demonstrating to the people of Ul'dah just how important cooperation is. I pray you do not waste your time.\nThe second, “Join forces with the Resistance,” is for the more experienced members of our Order. They will receive guidance from me as to how best to proceed.\nAnd the final, “Participate in the restoration of the Blessed,” is for a less traveled member of our Order. I hope you will find it enlightening.\nI pray you find the tasks I have outlined helpful. I would be ever so grateful if you could share your experiences with our Order in the comments section below!\nI look forward to your participation!', '\nPopmessage:', '\nYou are under attack!', '\nSeverian:', '\nGood. You are returned. What did you think of the mission?\nBravo! I knew I could count on you!\nThough I may not be in a position to offer you counsel, I wish to thank you personally for your assistance. It would not have been possible without your efforts.\nYour example has inspired me and my fellow Scions to greater heights. I look forward to the day when I can offer you the same advice.']

Dialogue: ['\nPrairillot:', '\nAh, Forename. I was hoping you would come along.\nI fear the pain I bear from losing my partner has yet to subside, and I fear that without the strength to fight on, I will be forever alone.\nThat is why I have decided to take up the sword once more─to give back what we have lost.\nBut there is still much work to be done.

I will not be further burdened by this burden.\nNow, as you may have noticed, this sword is far more than a mere tool. In order to hone its properties, it must be wielded with such force as to render the enemy defenseless.\nTo do this, however, I need to practice swinging it. And as you have seen, it is not something that can be done in a moment's rest.\nThat is why I am here─to help you realize just how difficult this training is. As you continue to improve, you will become a far better swordfighter.\nIn fact, I daresay that one day, you will even be able to match the feats performed by our comrades.\nUntil then, Forename."]
