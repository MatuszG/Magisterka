Dialogue: ['\nBujeg:', "\nYou have a look in your eyes I am certain you are seeking a blessed instrument. I am an instrument maker, and my instruments bear the name of Blessed.\nI recently came across a very special instrument in the stacks at the Musica Universalis. The stone was round and had a beautiful sound. I had never seen such a precious object.\nIt was not long into my research when I stumbled across the term “blessed instrument.” I knew then that I had to find the owner. I have searched high and low, but to no avail.\nIt may seem a trifling task, but if we are to honor our dead with instruments, we must be certain their souls are honored with instruments.\nI am certain the deceased used their lives to make beautiful music. If we are to give them the opportunity to hear their favorite pieces again, then we must make sure their instruments are played to perfection.\nI am certain the deceased used their lives to make beautiful music. If we are to give them the opportunity to hear their favorite pieces again, then we must make sure their instruments are played to perfection.\nSo I went about searching. I found a torn piece of parchment bearing a jumble of glyphs and sigils. At first I made no headings of it and simply kept it as a keepsake.\nI began to wonder who might have written it and what could be so important that it had not been kept in a more suitable place. When I found the name of the owner in the margins of the parchment, it was then that I realized this was a record of the passing of a long time ago.\nThe owner of the parchment was a dear friend of mine. She passed away not long ago. I wish I could write a few words of remembrance for her, but alas, I cannot.\nHowever, there is a more fitting place for this record than in a Musica Universalis cabinet. In the church where I serve, there is a place where we hold blessed instruments. It is a place of quiet sanctuary, where we may hear the voice of our departed loved ones.\nNow is a time for us to pause and honor this friend who passed. May we not let the passing of time bring us to our knees, but use this blessed instrument to honor her memory.\
