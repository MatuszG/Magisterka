Title: A Brief Reprieve
Dialogue: ['\nKriv:', "\nAh, Forename. Thank goodness you're here. I've heard some terrible news─the whole of Little Ala Mhigo is under attack!\nIt's been a bloody mess of a day, I'll grant you that. Not only are they attacking us, but they're also threatening to blow us all away! I don't want to die in a place I can't even call home.\nIt's not my place, you know. I'm not an Ala Mhigan, and I don't much care for the invaders. They're not my people, and I certainly don't want them attacking me.\nBut if you're willing to help, it'd be your duty to keep the peace─and to bring us food and medicine, so that we can live.\nI'd go myself, but I've a feeling I'm not the sort of man who'd risk his life for a handful of coin. I can't leave my post, though, so I'd ask that you search for me.\nI've been watching you, so if you could find me, I'd be ever so grateful.", '\nKriv:', "\nI've been watching you, so if you could find me, I'd be ever so grateful.", '\nKriv:', "\nI've been watching you, so if you could find me, I'd be ever so grateful.", '\nKriv:', "\nI've been watching you, so if you could find me, I'd be ever so grateful.", '\nKriv:', "\nI've been watching you, so if you could find me, I'd be ever so grateful.", '\nKriv:', "\nI've been watching you, so if you could find me, I'd be ever so grateful.", '\nKriv:', "\nI've been watching you, so if you could find me, I'd be ever so grateful.", '\nKriv:', "\nI've been watching you, so if you could find me, I'd be ever so grateful.", '\nKriv:', "\nI've been watching you, so if you could find me, I'd be ever so grateful.", '\nKriv:', "\nI've been watching you, so if you could find me, I'd be ever so grateful.", '\nKriv:', "\nI've been watching you, so if you could find me, I'd be ever so grateful.", '\nKriv:', '\nI've been watching you, so if you could find me, I'd be ever so grateful.', '\nKriv:', "\nI've been watching you, so if you could find me, I'd be ever so grateful
