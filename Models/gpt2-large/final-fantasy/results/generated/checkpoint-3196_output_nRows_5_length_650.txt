The name means “little forest,” and it was the name of a hamlet in Ul'dah prior to the Calamity.\nTo this day, the hamlet is held in low esteem by the Ul'dah high and low, but Iliud hopes to change that. He has long held the view that the noble family name should be changed to honor the contributions of the forest's cultivators.\nHe wrote to me earlier asking if I had a mind to offer my assistance. I gladly agreed to assist him.\nThough I am still a novice in the art of battle, I have already made many discoveries that will be of great benefit to the Order.\nThere is much I still need learn, but I have already begun to explore new frontiers. If I continue to work at this pace, I may yet be ready to take my place in the council in a matter of years.\nFather Iliud will surely be eager to hear of all that you have learned. I pray that he will be able to rely on you in the future."]

Might I trouble you to join the Convictors in their battle against the syrictae?\nThe syrictae inhabit the Isle of Zekki, a remote island to the south. They are, by and large, a peaceable bunch─much to the chagrin of the syrictae themselves.\nBut their disposition changes when the animals come to feast. In the past, the kobolds would only attack the unprepared. But now they will target anything and everything.\nI do not mean to send you into the fight, Forename. But if you see an attack coming on the island, and you are ready to fight, I would be ever so grateful if you could lend a hand.\nAs you know, the kobolds are not wont to wait for their meal to be finished. This means you must be the one to draw them out of their den. If you can draw four of them out, that should be sufficient.\nAnd I can think of nothing more suitable than a familiar. A familiar that can fly and use a variety of instruments. I would have you make one for the syrictae─I'll use it to call out to them.\nHere, take this. It's a horn. Use it to call out to the syrictae. And if they come to attack, use it again. I shall see that you are prepared.", '\nMinfilia:', '\nHow goes the making of the horn?', '\nMinfilia:', '\nOh my, this is wonderful! I shall add it to my collection.\nBut I must say, I was rather surprised by the results. While it certainly seems to have worked, I thought it would be more effective if the syrictae were to hear it in person.\nTo do so, I shall procure a syrictae of my own. Alas, I know nothing of them. Could you help me by searching for one?\nA syrictae is a bird of the same order as the syrictae in our own land. Would that I knew what they are.\nMy thanks again, Forename. I shall look into making another horn.\nThe syrictae are quite elusive, and I had no idea they could be so numerous. I am glad we were able to find one.\nIn fact, I think it's only fitting that the first thing you do upon your return is to give a horn to the soldier who gave you your first horn.\nIt's a small token of my gratitude, but I hope it brings you joy as well.\nI will see that it's properly placed on your person when you return.
