I hope you've not been resting on your laurels since last we met.\nI've been keeping a keen eye on the markets, and it seems that a few relics from the days of yore are on the rise.\nWhile I'm not overly confident in saying that these will fetch a handsome price, I am willing to take a stab at it.\nI would ask you to procure a variety of ancient weapons and armor for me. If you've a mind to do so, I've marked on the map where these items can be found.", '\nGiott:', "\nLet me see here... A wooden sword, a wooden spearhead, and a wooden bow.\nMy thanks, friend. I am quite confident that I can tell you which pieces will fetch a handsome price.\nAs for the rest, you'll have to find a merchant who deals in such wares to learn what sort of deals are on the table.\nYou'll find them just to the north of the Observatorium.\nIf you'd like to know more about the relics I've recommended, you can find them by speaking with the man at the desk.\nOh, and if you happen to have any objections to my recommending ancient relics, remember that the stories are not all that true. The truth is, many ancient relics were actually quite valuable in their day.\nThat said, I hope that you'll consider placing a small token of my recommendation in your pay. It would go a long way toward helping me continue to write about these subjects."]

But I've never had the chance to do any research before I came to this arrangement.\nI'd ask around, but no one's willing to talk to a fellow beekeeper.\nWould you mind taking these wasps to the south of here, and setting them free?

I'm sure you'll come up with a more clever solution."]

Anyway, you see, I'm quite confident in my theory that bees have evolved to carry out their roles more efficiently than any other animal.\nIn fact, if I were to come to a conclusion on my own, it would be that bees are the only animals capable of such a feat, and that they're the only intelligent beings in the world.\nIf you agree, we can continue with the experiment without fear of stifling our research!\nOf course, I'll need you to help me with the preparations─that's what this is all about, after all.\nMy colleague and I will need a sample of honeybee venom to test our hypothesis, but we can't obtain them from the Apis Coriacea hive, which is nestled in the Sagolii Desert.\nBut if we can't find the bees themselves, we can at least try to locate their hives using the hives' flagposts.\nI'll need you to go to Camp Tranquil in the Sagolii Desert and flagpoles one by one, ensuring that all are in one piece.\nI trust you will find it easy to spot a flagpost, even if it's situated in the middle of nowhere.\nIf you do find a flagpost, you'll want to flag it down, since the bees will fly away if they think you're trying to steal their bees.\nOnce you've found the bees, return to me and tell me. I'll try to replicate the experiment as best I can, and report back to you.\nOh, and if you happen to have any questions, I'm always happy to answer them!", '\nCid:', "I trust you were able to find the bees?\nGood, good!

Well, I am pleased to inform you that we have achieved a rather unexpected breakthrough in the search for the legendary honeybee.\nThe esteemed apiarist and his acolyte have succeeded in isolating a compound which, when administered to honeybees, renders them utterly incapable of flight.\nWhile this discovery brings us one step closer to realizing the ultimate dream of all beekeepers─the recreation of the ancient world─it is far from the solution we had hoped for.\nFor one, the compound we have created is far too potent to be of much use to ordinary honeybees. Moreover, the apiarist and his acolyte failed to account for how the pesticide would affect the hive, and thus the bees' population.\nStill, a solution is not the solution's intention. What is the ultimate dream of all beekeepers? To see our world reborn!\nI am certain my lady friend will be delighted to hear that her prayers have been heard. In the meantime, I would ask that you tend to the bees in our care.\nYou will find the bees in the area to the north of here.

Yet with your assistance, they have survived far longer than I could have imagined.\nThough we may never be able to recreate the world of ancient times, we may at least have the means to restore their former glory─and that glory is nothing if not glorious.\nMay the bees ever bless you!"]
