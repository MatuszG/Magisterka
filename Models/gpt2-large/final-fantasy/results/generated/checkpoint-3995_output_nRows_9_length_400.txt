I've been watching the exchange between you and Ardolain at the Octant, and it's come to an end!\nThe matter of the missing chocobo has been concluded, and the noble steed will be returned to his rightful owner.\nBut there is one last step to be taken─to deliver the bird to its final resting place.\nThe airship carries precious little cargo, and there are no easy means of transporting it from one place to another.\nIf you should have need of a carriage, you were my guest in Mhach before─just ask the innkeep.\nHere is the chocobo's registration form, as requested. Take it to the airship landing, and Ardolain should come to take the bird away when he is done.", '\nArdolain:', "\nWelcome to the Quicksand, Master Meffrid.

I haven't the foggiest what you just handed me. Well, it matters not. The noble steed will be home soon enough.\nWhen you have your chocobo, take it to the landing in front of the Quicksand.

Dialogue: ['\nDmitar:', "You've come at a good time, Blade Surname. I have a rather interesting report to share with you.\nWhile out on reconnaissance, our scouts happened upon relics we confirmed once belonged to Gunnhildr's Blades!\nIt was long believed the queen's guard possessed crystals within which they stored the knowledge of their fighting techniques, and this discovery has removed all doubt. These forgotten fragments, as we call them, may very well turn the tide of the war in our favor.\nYou see, much to our surprise, Master Gerolt claims to have experience working with similar crystals, and believes that the memories contained within can be extracted.\nHe has set fast to work on a means to do so, and assured us it won't be long before their secrets are revealed to us.\nYou may recall Gerolt, the man who helped bring you to your present moment. Well, he has one last task for you to perform, this time around.\nTake these memories and use them to recreate the scene in which you first encountered Gunnhildr's Blades.\nStart by locating the frozen docks in the southeast of the city. Retrieve any memories you can find from the memory crystal there, and use that to recreate the scene.\nWhen you have recreated the scene, deliver them to Lady Laniaitte at the Adders' Nest.\nLady Laniaitte will be quite pleased to hear of your efforts.\nOh, and before you go, I would ask that you submit your memories to be stored here at the Adders' Nest. I believe you'll find the formulae and explanations she requested are within.\nPlease be aware that, while your efforts to date have borne fruit, there is still the matter of completing the mission.\nLady Laniaitte will be waiting for you at

Dialogue: ['\nLucinne:', "\nAh, Forename. It's good of you to come. I'm sure Tataru and Almet will be pleased to see you.\nOn behalf of the Scions, I send my thanks.\nAs you may have heard, the Ala Mhigan refugees were originally brought here to provide for the continued survival of our people.\nThe Ala Mhigan Resistance, meanwhile, continues to fight for the liberation of our homeland. For many years, our comrades have struggled to find an appropriate balance between their duties and their personal lives.\nBut no longer will that problem be solved by concentrating solely on the military.\nAs a gesture of goodwill, the Resistance has agreed to refrain from taking any military action that could be construed as intending to seize the initiative.\nFor the time being, at least. Tataru and Almet will remain in Ul'dah to continue their work on behalf of the Scions.\nThey will be joined by General Raubahn at the Rising Stones. It is my hope that they will agree to meet you there.", '\nAlmet:', "\nMy duties as commander demand I remain here. But I am glad to see you both here.", '\nRaubahn:', '\nAs you wish, General.', '\nRaubahn:', "\nI'll be damned! I was so certain that I'd sent the wrong person!\nAlmet, Forename─this is Raubahn at his most effusive. I do not believe I have ever met a man so selfless, so loyal...\nTataru and Almet are truly blessed to have you both here.\nI know I cannot claim to understand your motivations, but I have a friend who does. Namely, his son. He is a man of great promise

Might I assume you are the outsider who helped thwart the plot to destroy the Victory?\nYou have served our cause well, and we would not have denied you the opportunity to make amends.\nBut now that the threat has been eliminated, we would ask that you return to the House of Commons to deliver a gift.\nWe have already given you a letter, which you may deliver to Cid Garlond at the House of Commons.\nThe Resistance will see you back at the House of Commons.', '\nCid:', "\nWelcome back, Forename.

You've done the nation a great service today.\nNow, what would you say to a few words of thanks?\nBy the House of Commons, I presume? Aye, it is only right that you be honored for your service.\nI should not be surprised if Resistance sympathizers were among the audience at the banquet. I suspect they were, and I thank them for standing with us during the darkest hours of our nation's history.\nIn fact, it has been my sincerest hope that the friends you met at the House of Commons would one day join your fight against the Garleans.\nAnd I am certain that the day will come. For now, I ask that you seek out Cid at the House of Commons. Pray convey my warmest regards.", '\nResistancegatekeeper:', '\nGreetings, sir.
