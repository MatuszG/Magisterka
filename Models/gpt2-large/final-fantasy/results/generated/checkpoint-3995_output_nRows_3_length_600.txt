We must recover the documents belonging to House Haillenarte's ancestors.\nAlthough I understand the importance of records and the importance of secrecy, House Dzemael has never been known for its documents.\nEven if they were to turn up, there is no telling what effect they might have on the current government.

Let us proceed to the extraction stage.\nThe extraction process is no simple affair. Dzemaelite must be extracted in sufficient amounts to ensure that the crystals are rendered safe.\nAt this point, it is important that you and your party remain vigilant. Any delay could jeopardize the extraction process.\nOnce the crystals are in the correct quantities, it is time to begin the final step─completing the final step.\nThis is where you must prove yourself the “man of the hour” that you are. For this, you will be pitted against wave after wave of Dzemaelite warriors. But you will not be defeated!\nDzemaelite crystals are known to grow to heights of ten thousand thousand years. Even the most ferocious of the beasts will falter before the mighty Warrior of Light.\nYou will need to employ every resource at your disposal to ensure your victory. And by the time you return, I hope to have learned a thing or two about you.\nGood luck, Forename. I look forward to seeing you again."]

The mere fact that you're here should tell you as much.\nI'm reasonably confident that I can find someone suitable, but I'm also fairly certain that I've made a terrible mistake. As much as I would like to make this decision for you─and you're not exactly shy about accepting the role─I think it best that you find out for yourself.\nIf you'd be so kind as to seek out a capable young harpist, I'd be most obliged if you could locate him near the Clave.

He should be able to play the instrument without much difficulty.\nIt's a pity he couldn't find a worthy candidate, but as this is a small step towards realizing our dream of playing together, we cannot be content with merely meeting potential partners.\nIf we are to truly realize our dreams, it is essential that we find partners who share our passion for the harp.\nIf you're looking for someone to play the harp, perhaps you'll be able to find the answer to your question.\nI should hope so!

I believe I speak on behalf of all the Scions when I say that your deeds have been instrumental in the sultana's triumph.\nYou have my sincerest gratitude.\nI will not pretend that our arrangement is different from others. We share a common dream of rebuilding the House of Ul.\nYou have doubtless heard that the sultanate is split into two, and that each is ruled by a different family.\nHowever, the reality is somewhat different. The dukes, marquis, and noble families that constitute the upper echelons of our society are all descended from the same ancestors.\nSome of these families have maintained close ties with Ul'dah, while others have drifted away.\nUl'dah is home to countless races and clans, and it is these that the sultana seeks to win over.\nThat is why she has taken such care to learn the histories and customs of each people she comes across.\nSo while the dukes and marquis may be the focus of her attention, her main focus is

In the case of your yarzon, this means putting it through its paces in the desert.\nThe weapon will likely require a number of adjustments before you can perform its duties as well, so make certain to keep that log open and accessible to you.\nNow, if all is in order...I trust you have learned a thing or two about the importance of durability in your quest for perfection.\nWell, well...I see what you did there. I trust I can count on your services in the future?\nI am ever pleased to have an accomplished craftsman such as yourself assisting me. I look forward to working with you again!\nOh, but before that, I should give you something to remember the day you passed your final test. It would not do to deliver the good news too early!\nI am ever grateful for the opportunity to teach you, my friend, but especially so in the case of a student who has passed their final test. Here is a little something to reward your efforts.\nBy the grace of our gods, you are now worthy of a new and improved yarzon! I pray that it serves you well into the future!']
