Dialogue: ['\nMogmont:', "I'm sorry to cut short your conversation, but I'd like to thank you for helping me track down my missing colleagues.\nWhile they were away, a band of mongrels attacked and stole several kobolds. I was able to slay four and reclaim my men.\nYou have my deepest thanks. They were most definitely not my comrades─the beasts devoured them before I realized it was my own kin.\nThe mongrels I slew were smaller and more agile than the rest. I suspect they may have been seeking a more vulnerable prey to steal. I'll make sure this doesn't happen again.\nMight you be interested in hunting one of them down? I would not ask you to hunt alone, of course, but I would be most grateful for any help you could offer.\nI can't thank you enough. It's a relief to know my colleagues are safe."]

Dialogue: ['\nCibleroit:', "\nWell, I'm pleased to say I've managed to finish up my research on the matter of bees.\nWhile I was speaking with our researchers, I came across a rather curious theory that's been floating around the Convictory.\nAccording to the theory, bees are somehow connected to the life cycle of flowers, and that the flowers themselves are the source of their nectar.\nThough I'm not entirely convinced of this theory, it does explain a few things. For one, bees are far more numerous than any other creature, and they're quite intelligent as well. It also makes sense that the bees would evolve to become something with the ability to pollinate other flowers─something which, by virtue of being a flower, has the ability to pollinate itself.\nBut I'm sure I'm missing something obvious. You see, bees are known to be rather fond of shiny objects. And by shiny I mean “sparkly,” of course!\nAnd since shiny objects are popular, it stands to reason that they would be popular with the bees as well. As such, it would make perfect sense that shiny objects would be the source of nectar for bees.\nA curious theory, yes? Let us investigate!\nBut before we delve into this theory, it would be wise to gather some evidence for or against it. And that evidence could come in the form of a few shiny objects.\nFor this, I recommend you speak with the bees themselves.

Perhaps you can lend us an an artisan's tool, and we can use it to accomplish a noble task?\nThat would be a most welcome change, and such an artisan would surely be of great help to our cause.\nThe craftsman who can make this instrument is stationed at the Adders' Nest, in southern Thanalan.

Dialogue: ['\nOtanyaratan:', "\nAha! I see you've returned! Thanks to you, we were able to find a way to enhance your relic, and now it's ready to use!\nThe method we used is rather unique, but I think it's worth sharing with you all.\nYou see, we wanted to make use of the weapon's unique properties when fighting creatures that were resistant to normal weapons. For this, we needed to create a special alloy, and in the process of doing so, stumbled upon a rather peculiar ingredient─crystals.\nThe crystals, as you might imagine, are common enough in Thanalan, and we had no trouble finding them.\nUnfortunately, however, we had no idea what sort of crystal was responsible for the unique properties of our relic. We even went so far as to ask the leaders of nearby tribes to send their own samples, but to our utter surprise, none of them came to answer our query.\nThat's when we realized that we'd stumbled across the answer to our question at last! A single crystal, found in the heart of a sacred tree─the key to creating a truly magical weapon!\nWhen combined with the crystal's other unique properties, such as the fact that it can be used to amplify the power of a weapon, we were able to create a weapon that could bestow its wielder with an almost limitless amount of destructive power.\nThis discovery led us to believe that the crystal we'd found was the key to creating such a weapon, and so we embarked on a mission to find its location. Our search ultimately led us to a place called the Black Shroud, where we discovered the remains of a tribe that had long ago abandoned its home.\nWe believe that the tribe's leader, having long ago abandoned its home, had somehow been tricked into coming to this place, and that it is these remnants that contain the crystal.\nAnd so, as a gesture of goodwill, we'd like to give this weapon a try─to see if it's truly possessed of such destructive power. We would like for you to take part in our endeavor, and assist us in our search.\nHead to the Black Shroud in Thanalan and search for the crystal we've been searching for. We'll be waiting for you!", '\nOtanyaratan:', '\nI trust you still remember where we found the crystal?

Title: A Bold Decision
Dialogue: ['\nHasty Hunter:', "Ah, <Clickable(<If(GreaterThan(PlayerParameter(52),0))><Player's Grand Company Rank>)/> Surname! Might you have a moment to spare for a well-meaning adventurer?\nSome unfortunate news has arrived via courier─the very worst of news, in fact. The poor fellow has been conscripted by the Empire's forces, and is being held in a labor camp near the capital.\nA shame, but not all regrets come from the heart. Sometimes regrets are born of foolish dreams and reckless actions.\nI fear that the conscripted man is likely to be starved of food and water for days to come. I would ask that you aid him in his hunger strike if you are able.\nI would ask that you aid the conscripted man in his hunger strike if you are able. Please see him to the Hungering Man.", '\nConscripted Hunter:', "Thank you ever so much for coming!\nI had been resigned to following in the footsteps of my father, who served in the Imperial army. I had no real hope of changing my fate, and had even contemplated suicide.\nBut then I received word that a hunter had spotted a wild boar in the area─one of the most prolific in the region, if I may say so. I knew I had made the right decision, and set out to hunt it.\nI was lucky. A group of hunters came upon me shortly after I returned and asked if I had seen a wild boar. I said no, but I am certain I saw it. I took it as a sign that something was amiss.\nThey told me that one of the soldiers had been conscripted into the conscripting program. They said they had seen nothing of use in their time at the camp, and that the man had been summarily dispatched.\nI had no idea that my father had been conscripted. I had no idea that he had sacrificed himself to bring me up to the standards he set for himself.\nI wish I had never consented to join the Empire, but I know now that I would be better served by following in his footsteps. If I must become a hunter, then I would do well to remember that there is more glory in hunting than in hunting itself.\nThank you for your help, <Clickable(<If(GreaterThan(PlayerParameter(52),0))><Player's Grand Company Rank>)/>. You have saved a life today."]

Dialogue: ['\nMogmont:', "You've the look of a man who knows what he's about. I'm a guildmaster, and I must make a decision─one that will save this guild, and this guild's future.\nIf I am to continue to lead my guild, I must see to it that my subordinates are well fed and clothed. As such, I am in need of an adventurer's aid.\nYou see, I'm in the midst of preparing for the arrival of our newest recruit, and I would like to surprise him with something, but only if I know it will be a surprise.\nIf you would be so kind as to procure some dried meat for him, I would be most grateful. I will go ahead and notify my superiors of the incident as soon as I am able.", '\nMogmont:', 'Please, procure some dried meat for my new recruit.

I will give him this meat in the name of the guild.\nOh, and before I forget, I should probably mention that the meat is extremely dangerous. Do not take it lightly.\nMogmont is always in need of new and exciting recruits. We can only do so much as we are given, so it is important that you do all in your power to help him.", '\nMogmont:', "Ah, you're back. Were you able to procure the meat?\nOh my, this is...\nOh my, this is truly... My, my, this is... <sob>\nYou see, when a beast grows too large for its natural habitat, it will sometimes move to a new location, and that is where the meat is found.\nTo make the most of this opportunity, you must be prepared to move quickly. For this, you will need to hunt something that is both large and deadly.\nThe meat is harvested from the tundra, but it is only through such arduous and dangerous journeys that we can obtain it.\nIt is for this reason that we always have need of new and more energetic recruits. You have proven yourself to be a worthy addition to our ranks, and for this you have my thanks."]
