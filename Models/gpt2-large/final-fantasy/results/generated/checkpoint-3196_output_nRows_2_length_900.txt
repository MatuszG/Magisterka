Title: A Beeautiful Plan
Dialogue: ['\nNimbus:', '\nI must ask you to assist me once more. As you know, I sent a runner to Camp Cloudtop to inquire after a certain individual.\nWhile the inquirer was on his rounds, a group of voidsent attacked him. I did not see him fall, but I did hear him scream─and I know I was there.\nI would go and search for him myself, but I have work to do here. Please, go to the main plaza and search for him.\nAnd...if you would return to the Great Work, please do so by way of recompense. I cannot forgive myself if this man died while wandering the wilderness.\nThank you, hunter. I will see that you are properly compensated.', '\nNimbus:', '\nI cannot thank you enough. There is still much I need do to complete the rest of my plan. Please, go and look for him again.', '\nNimbus:', '\nYou have returned. Do you have news of the missing hunter?', '\nNimbus:', '\nAh, yes. He is fine, thank goodness.\nThe hunter spoke highly of you. It seems he sees you as a sort of equal to him.\nIt was clear that you and he were very different people before the Calamity. He told me as much.\nIt seems I owe you an apology. While I may have been harsh in the past, I now realize how much it means to him to have you as his equal.\nPlease, accept this as a token of my thanks.']

Title: A Beeautiful Plan
Dialogue: ['\nBroomc:', '\nYou there, traveler! I need help!\nI'm planning a trip to the honeybee hive, but I have a beekeeper on staff who is rather busy, and he's supposed to be handing out the honey.\nThe problem is, I'm not certain what the hive needs at this particular moment. Do you think you could go in search of the bees?\nI would go myself, but I'm rather busy with my own tasks. If you could go in my stead, I would be in your debt.\nPlease, take this as payment. I will thank you again in person!', '\nBroomc:', '\nI am in your debt! Thank you so much!\nHmmm... I think I remember seeing some dark-coloured bees near the entrance. Do you think you could do me a favor and check them for me?\nThank you! I will take them to my supervisor, who is stationed outside the hive. You should be able to find her just outside the entrance.\nPlease, take this as payment. I will thank you again in person!', '\nBroomc:', '\nThe dark-coloured bees were there? Were you able to find them?\nOh my, such a large colony! I will add it to our already-growing list of accomplishments.\nI'm sure you are wondering why we would want to keep bees in a small, confined space. Well, the bees are essential to our survival.\nThe more they pollinate our flowers, the more nectar we get. And since the flowers are produced by the same species of bee that makes honey, we get a constant supply of food.\nAs long as we keep the bees healthy and happy, there is no threat to our continued prosperity. We have been able to maintain this system for generations, and I'm sure it would be difficult for any one person to change it.\nYou are an adventurer, are you not? Do you think you could help us again? We would be most grateful if you could visit our beekeeper once again and hand him the payment for our work.']

Dialogue: ['\nJantellot:', '\nIf you have the time, I would greatly appreciate your help. I am in need of two stingers, but I cannot obtain them from the apas.\nI would go myself, but I fear I would be devoured before I could finish the job. Please, would you retrieve them for me?', '\nJantellot:', '\nPlease bring me two stingers from the apas. They are hard to miss.', '\nJantellot:', '\nWere you able to find them?\nThank you so much. I shall put them to good use.\nWhile we are discussing how best to proceed, allow me to thank you once again. Without your aid, I may not be able to continue my research. \nYou are a true inspiration, not to mention a dear friend. I am forever in your debt.']
