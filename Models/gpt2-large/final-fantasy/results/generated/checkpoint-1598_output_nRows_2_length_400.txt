I take it the crystals you have brought us were not what we expected.\nAs you may have gathered, the crystalline ore we have acquired has the property of conferring an insulating property upon any weapon infused with it.\nThis property makes it ideal for enhancing any weapon with which we have already forged our weapons, enhancing both appearance and function.\nIn exchange for your services, I ask that you perform the same for me.\nAs promised, I will brief you on the particulars of our plan.']

Be sure to keep an eye out for any danger─the beeswax flowers are liable to be infested with dangerous insects.", '\nSerendipity:', "\nYou have gathered the beeswax? Then I shall need to run some tests to see whether the beeswax is indeed as effective as I had hoped.\nTo begin with, I need you to gather forty-five bottles of beeswax.
