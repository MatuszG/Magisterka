Dialogue: ['\nBraya:', "Well met, friend! I've a gift for you, if you're willing!\nI just saw some─aye, a few─of the greatest adventurers this side of Norvrandt, and they were most enthralling!\nIt was their battle with the anoles that inspired me to make this batch of mushroom soup! I had hoped to make it myself, but─ahem. It's just not practical.\nThe recipe is simple enough: boil a whole batch of mushroom soup, then strain the liquid through a sieve. You'd need a sieve three times as thick as this to get any decent yield.\nThe advantage of this method is that it removes any impurities that may have leached from the hull of the mushrooms, keeping the flavor lively and the ingredients fresh.\nI can't wait to see just how excited you'll be when I give the final batch to you!\nThe anoles are one of the most difficult creatures to grow in the cave. I'd never be able to make my soup without them, and it's a wonder that I made it this far!\nBut enough about me─here's the gift!\nI'd never be able to forgive myself if I hadn't given you this. It was a gift, and I hope you'll enjoy it as much as I do.\nI hope that I'll be able to repay your kindness one day! I'll give this to you as thanks for your help!"]

I study the histories of all the wars we've fought. I've been looking for an interesting piece to put together.\nIf there's one thing I've learned about all the wars, it's that they all start with a struggle for territory.\nA small group of people band together and fight their way to the center of the enemy encampment. From there, it gets a little more complicated.\nThere was a king in the Azim Steppe, an ancient ruler who united the steppe tribes. He was known as the “Azim,” which means “king.”\nHe was a brilliant tactician, but his genius was dulled by a cruel warlord who controlled his opponents from the shadows. His name was Marathos.\nThe Azim eventually fell, but not before a few of their members took up arms and fought in the war. These were known as the “Briardien Blue.”\nMarathos is currently in hiding, but we're hoping you can help us locate him.\nHe's a rather sinister character, to be sure, but he's not unlike you─a man with a mission. We need you to find him and bring him to us alive.\nThe Azim Steppe is a territory in northern Azim that we've struggled to claim for ourselves. We believe it belongs to the ancient ruler, but our neighbors are wary of us.\nThey hold a grudge against us for taking their lands, and they've sent marauders to threaten our researchers. The more we research the history of all the wars, the more we learn about the people who fought in them, but at the same time, we worry that our work will all be lost if we're not careful.\nI couldn't bear for that to happen to our country, so I decided to do something about it. I began researching the history of the peoples who fought in the war, and I was hoping to come across something that would help put things in perspective.\nAfter some searching, I found this piece of information that may be of interest to you. It describes a man named Marathos.\nMarathos was a member of the Azim Steppe before he took up arms in our country's battles. He is described as having been killed fighting for our nation, and having a “blessed instrument.”\nThe Azim Steppe is said to be filled with various types of ancient artifacts, but none that we know of have been found so far.\nI'm positive this will help put things in perspective, though.

Let us return to Wright.', '\nGaldon:', 'Your victory is already the talk of the town. I wonder if we may now turn our attention to the task of purging the forest of beastman.\nThough I daresay it is a work in progress. Countless men and women still suffer from the effects of the Calamity.\nI do not know what we can do to help them, but there is still time. We must recover our strength before the beastmen come back to wreak havoc once more.']

Dialogue: ['\nZlatan:', "\nAs Gerolt mentioned, we will require some manner of reagent to bind the crystal's aether to the weapon.\nFor this particular transaction, the House of Splendors is but an intermediary for the manufacturer. Goblin metalworkers of some renown in Idyllshire, apparently.\nAccording to Regana, despite the material requiring the use of some sort of special forge, she was able to negotiate a reasonable agreement. It still struck me as rather a lopsided deal in their favor, to be sure, but we have little choice but to take her word for it...\nFor our part in the bargain, we've been asked to procure a variety of goods. Our main focus, however, has been to explore new possibilities for use in the weapon's aether regulation process.\nSupposedly, the House of Splendors has established a new research facility in the neighboring region of Albreda's Longstop. We're hoping to entice the goblins to relocate there so that we can begin our work.\nWith or without us, however, the goblins will undoubtedly take notice of our efforts. We've drawn up a list of items we hope may be of interest to them, as well as the manner in which they might be used.\nHopefully, our efforts will prove to be of assistance to you in your quest for the reagent. Let me know when you are ready to proceed."]

Dialogue: ['\nBertliana:', '\nThe waters around Costa del Sol continue to rise, threatening to swallow all that remains of the native flora and fauna of the region.\nThe threat is not simply physical─weakened flora and fauna are depleted of their natural reserves, their young and dormant ones unable to find their way back to the motherland.\nThe situation is dire, but we cannot suffer to see the region lose its vibrant nature.\nI would ask you to procure six varieties of flowers, three varieties of grass, and three varieties of mushroom─a total of sixty-two items, to be precise.\nPlease do not hesitate to let me know of any you do not wish to part with. I will make my best to fulfill your request, but I cannot promise that everything will go smoothly.', '\nBertliana:', '\nI am glad to hear that you have brought me everything I asked for. Please take this as a token of my gratitude.']

Dialogue: ['\nMaucolyn:', "\nWe've received word from Ser Leaudaste of your success in wresting the crown from the Ironworks. The Miners' Guild has expressed its intent to contract with you for work in their vast underground complex.\nIf all goes to plan, you will be permitted to construct and operate your own giant pit. It will be far bigger than the one we currently use, and will doubtless be manned by some of the most gifted miners the realm has ever seen.\nConsidering the unparalleled skill and resources at our disposal, it stands to reason that the guild would only be second to none in finding the most talented individuals to join your endeavor.\nBut, as you are doubtless aware, our representatives have only limited access to the mining sites they represent. Thus do they often find themselves sent to smaller, more isolated places to conduct their business.\nIt would be a boon to both our reputation and our economy if you could travel widely and stay abreast of developments. Thus do we invite you to accept this unprecedented offer from the Miners' Guild.\nBy way of a reward, you will be provided with ample opportunity to hone your skills and expand your network. Should you wish to undertake any further commissions, we will be glad to offer them to you.\n", '\nPop:', '\nYou sense a hostile presence!', '\n(- Womana -):', '\n<gasp>', '\n(- Womana -):', '\nOh, no!', '\n(- Womana -):', '\n<gasp>', '\n(- Womana -):', '\nOh, no!', '\n(- Womana -):', '\n<gulp>', '\n(- Womana -):', '\n<gulp>', '\n(- Womana -):', '\n<gulp>', '\n(- Womana -):', '\n<gulp>', '\n(- Womana -):', '\n<gulp>', '\n(- Womana -):', '\n<gulp>', '\n(- Womana -):', '\n<gulp>', '\n(- Womana -):', '\n<gulp>', '\n(- Womana -):', '\n<gulp>', '\n(- Womana -):', '\n<gulp>', '\n(- Womana -):', '\n<gulp>', '\n(- Womana -):', '\n<gulp>', '\n(- Womana -):', '\n<gulp>', '\n(- Womana -):', '\n<gulp>', '\nMaucolyn:', "\nWelcome back, Forename!

Dialogue: ['\nAganbold:', '\nI am loath to trouble you again, but...there is a matter I would ask of you.\nI was recently approached by a man─a trader─who asked if I would be willing to trade me some of the fish I catch.\nI am resolute to refuse such an offer, but my conscience will not allow it. I know not where he procured them, but I fear he may have brought them from the Great Work.\nIf you can travel to the Work and retrieve them from the depths, it would be a great comfort to me.\nI should warn you, however, that the fish you seek are known to catch only by the most skilled of trappers.\nShould you fail to obtain them in time, I fear you will be faced with a rather nasty sting.
