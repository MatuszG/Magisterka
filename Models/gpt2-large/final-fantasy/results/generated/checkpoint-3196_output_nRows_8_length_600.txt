It is an honor and a privilege to do so, but I cannot in good conscience place the interests of my fellow House members first.\nFor our part, the House of Commons is united in our determination to oppose the Empire─but we are not monolithic. There are those who favor negotiation, and there are those who favor submission.\nUl'dah is fortunate to have a representative who can mediate between the Houses, but I fear that she has little ability to win over those who favor war.\nSo long as we live in a nation ruled by a House of Ul, we must remain neutral, and our representatives must be free to speak their mind. If I am to be a representative, I must be free to do so─and I cannot do so as a slave to the will of the House of Ul.\nThus, I turn to you for aid.

And I would be most grateful if you would assist me in my research.\nI am currently conducting tests on a new creation, and need your help in ensuring that it meets all of its potential.\nI have designed this instrument to resemble a sinewy branch of the lyre─think of it as a trilobite for the purposes of assisting with its research.\nUnfortunately, the design does not take into account the myriad possibilities afforded by living creatures, such as sinewy branches, fronds, and worms.\nIn order to encourage and encourage the development of the sinewy branch, I have imbued it with an aetherial core. This core serves as the means by which I maintain control of the instrument.\nIf the branch developed further, it would no doubt be an extremely powerful entity. Should that day come when we need to remove the core, we would be faced with a decision: do we cut the branch down, or allow it to develop further?\nI am asking you this not because I would be happy to see the branch perish, but rather so that it may develop further. If you would be so kind as to ensure that this happens, please find me and provide me with the appropriate aetherial core.\nYou have my thanks. I am currently assessing the branch at my home. Please hurry and find me so that I may make the necessary adjustments.\nOh, and if you do happen to find yourself in the area, do make sure to introduce yourself to my colleague, Gibrillont.

I am honored to have had the opportunity to work with such an accomplished individual.\nNow, before we proceed, I must warn you that this branch will be extremely powerful. Allow me to explain.\nAs you have undoubtedly noticed, sinewy branches are exceptionally hard to develop. Thus, when faced with a task that requires the development of a new branch, we use every available resource─chemical, physical, and a bit of both

I am proud to say that our efforts have paid handsome dividends. Ishgard is now a stronghold of the Resistance, and a bulwark against the Empire in its efforts to subjugate our lands. But, as I told you before, foreign engagements are few and far between. And as our representative to the council, it has become increasingly difficult for me to travel without being mobbed by admirers. For a man of your talents, such a situation should not be too difficult. As you well know, I have been tasked with facilitating the exchange of letters between our peoples. Of late, however, I have been overwhelmed with the volume of correspondence. I have attempted to streamline the process, but there is still much to do. I would be grateful if you could continue to assist me. Here, pray accept this as a token of my gratitude."]

Yes, I am right, I suppose I am.\nYou have the honor of addressing me, yes?\nAye, I am a conjurer by trade, though I am not so stubborn as to deny myself the pleasures of the trade. I enjoy the company of fine men and women.\nBut I must confess, my tastes run much wider than that. I have a mind to travel, and to do so, I must needs entertain myself. And I am fond of fine wine.\nHm? A bottle of vintage Ale, would you? It is the only drink I will allow myself.\nAfter a day of adventuring, one can be quite forgetful. A good glass of vintage Ale is a refreshing change from the pungent broth of soup and gristly grub.\nIt is not the most flavorful of libations, but it will afford one a moment of respite from the grueling pace of adventuring. And it will afford me the time to reflect on the tasks I have failed to complete.\nYou will find that the ale I bestow upon you is one of my most precious possessions. Aye, I will give it to you freely, no matter how small.\nIt was not always thus. As a child, I attended the Studium, where I honed my skills in the study of magic. I then continued on to the Conjurers' Guild, where I served as conjurer in residence.\nI have since retired from active duty, having fulfilled my duties in the best manner. But even after my time as a conjurer, I continued to enjoy the fine things that I did not.\nOne day, it struck me: what if these things were to be shared with the people of Gridania? What if I were to give these bottles of vintage Ale to the children of the Respite, so they might have a respite from their hardships?\nYes, a little something to lift their spirits, just as they did for me. And so I resolved to make this little experiment. I had no doubt that it would be well received.\nI had not thought to involve myself directly in the politics of the time, but I had no doubt that the people of Gridania would welcome my gift.

I've even heard some suggest you're somehow connected to them.\nBut if you insist... I'll explain.\nAs a novice craftsman, it is my responsibility to learn all that I can of the craft. However, it is ultimately my decision whether or not I continue to pursue this path.\nIn the past, I would go days, even weeks, without sleep. Yet, through sheer determination, I was able to finish what I started.\nIn order to do so, however, I had to sacrifice many of my possessions. Things like this remind me of those lost opportunities...\nWhen I was first starting out, I did not even know what “craftsmanship” meant. I simply did not know what was right.\nHowever, with the help of countless admirers, I have come to understand what it means to master the art.\nSo much so, that I now believe it is within each artisan─not the guildmaster─who is most deserving of their livelihood.\nToday, I would give you a piece of advice. Do not let the fact that you are no longer of the artisan profession put you off. It will give you the strength to persevere.\nIf you wish to become a craftsman in your own right, it is essential that you learn more of the craft. The sooner you do, the sooner you can make a living as a craftsman.\nNow then─here is your reward. Please take it and leave me in peace."]

Title: A Breath of Respite
Dialogue: ['\nHasty Hunter:', "You look like you've been around a bit. What do you reckon your chances are of smashing a dragon's skull with a spear?\nIf you're wondering whether to go for it yourself or pass on to a friend, I say go for it!\nI'll go ahead and mark down the suitable area for a hunt. Make sure you're ready when I get there.\nHere, take this.\nIt's a powder made from dragon fang and horn. I mix it with the regular hunting grounds' tincture and it makes for a potent antidote.\nWhen a fight breaks out, the antidote will draw the dragon's attention away from the wounded. It might even draw it out into a fight it's not ready to fight.\nI can usually handle anything that big. But this is a whole other ballgame. Be careful out there, all right?\nHead over to the area I marked and make sure you're ready. I'll be waiting for you.", '\nHasty Hunter:', "You're back! How did it go?\nOh, I love that look! Such a resounding success! With this, I can finally bring the hunt to a close.\nNow we'll head back to Rhalgr's Reach. I hope you don't get tired of hearing that name, because it's not meant to scare you. It's meant to bring you cheer!"]

Dialogue: ['\nVorsaile:', "\nAye, I heard you and Lady Minfilia talking about Aleport. I'm sure you're curious to know what's in it.\nWell, it's a bit of a sorry state when you consider the fact that the whole port's been laid to waste by the Calamity. Nary a day goes by when we don't hear some tale of the horrors that befell our fair city.\nTo make matters worse, the rebuilding effort has been hampered by a number of factors. Some of them are entirely within our control, but some are not.\nBut I can tell you're not one of them. So I want you to go to Aleport and speak with a man named Gundobald.\nIt's a bit of a detour, but you can get there from the Rosehouse. Just make sure you're well prepared─Gundobald can be a grueling taskmaster if you don't take it easy.\nAnd remember: you'll find Minfilia at the Rosehouse.", '\nGundobald:', "\nWelcome, welcome! What can I help you with, adventurer?\nHmph. So you're the one they say is coming to help with the rebuilding.\nOf course you're the one they say is coming to help with the rebuilding. I can see it in their eyes.\nBut I can tell you what they're not telling you. The Calamity changed Aleport beyond all recognition.\nHalf the city's still rubble, and a good many of the workers have been forced to relocate.\nIt's a struggle to get goods through the port, and even if we do get them, we're usually forced to pay exorbitant prices.\nIt's a struggle to get people to come here in the first place, and even if we do get them, we're usually forced to pay exorbitant prices.\nSo we came up with a solution that would allow us to bring some relief to our suffering people─a little something that would give them a little breathing room.\nIt's a little something we call “respite.” It's a nice little thing that gives our workers a little something to do, even if they're not working.\nIt's a small thing, but we think it might be enough to make our people feel better. If you can spare a moment, you should let the man know.", '\nMinfilia:', '\nAh, there you are. How fare you?\nGood, good. I take it you had a pleasant talk with Gundobald?\nI see. That is unfortunate. The rebuilding effort has been hampered by a number of factors, but none more so than the Calamity.\

Dialogue: ['\nYedjina:', '\nGreetings, traveler. I am glad you are here to hear my humble requiem.\nI am afraid I have nothing further to add on that front, but please accept this as a small token of my gratitude.\nYou see, for a time I wished to pursue a career in the arts. However, I soon found myself beset with a series of unfortunate misunderstandings that prevented me from pursuing my true calling.\nNow beholding you, I am confident that I can now make a living as an artist. This, to me, is a dream come true!\nPlease accept this as a small token of my gratitude. I would be forever in your debt.', '\nPop:', '\nYou sense a hostile presence!', '\nYedjina:', '\nNow listen closely. I am going to ask you to perform a sacred ritual.\nYou must place before yourself a series of clay figures. Each figure represents a different aspect of my past.\nWhen you have finished, close your eyes and imagine returning to it, refreshed and renewed.\nIt is time that you honored this most treasured memory. Now, begin.', '\nYedjina:', '\nNow listen closely. I am going to ask you to perform a sacred ritual.\nYou must place before yourself a series of clay figures. Each figure represents a different aspect of my past.\nWhen you have finished, close your eyes and imagine returning to it, refreshed and renewed.\nIt is time that you honored this most treasured memory. Now, begin.', '\nYedjina:', '\nOh my, this is quite a collection of clay! I am humbled to think that I was never able to make use of all of this at once.\nIn my youth I was quite handy with a hammer, but I soon learned that it is better to wield a hammer than a sword. As such, I decided to only focus on using weapons during training.\nOf late, however, I have struggled to find the time to train. I am afraid it is almost impossible to maintain such a high level of proficiency with a tool while also pursuing my dream of becoming an artist.\nThat is why I am grateful to you, traveler. Not only for performing my requiem, but also for renewing my faith in the arts.\nThank you once again. I look forward to performing the ritual with you again in the near future.\nLastly, I would like to give you a small gift. I hope it will bring you great joy when you hold it in your hands.']
