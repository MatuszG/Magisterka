Dialogue: ['\nDmitar:', 'Greetings, Blade Surname. I take it you will soon be joining the others on the southern front, yes?\nThough my duties have kept me here for the most part, I have heard tell of the carnage wrought in battle by enemy soldiers and their warmachina.\nIndeed, the imperials often prefer to wait until their intended target has been weakened before sending more troops to deliver the final blow. Yet for all their cunning, they are remarkably predictable.\nLet us suppose you destroyed one of their warmachina, and the enemy receives word of your victory. They would no doubt assume the effort have left you exhausted, perhaps even badly wounded. A perfect opportunity to send reinforcements and overwhelm you.\nBut what if, unbeknownst to them, we are prepared for the arrival of these additional troops? It would be an opportunity to further diminish their ranks.\nI would ask you venture out onto the battlefield and fell two 4th Legion nimrods and two 4th Legion slashers.\nShould they decide to send reinforcements, there will be no element of surprise to favor them.', '\nDmitar:', "It should take no more than the defeat of two 4th Legion nimrods and two 4th Legion slashers to draw the Garleans' attention.

I see no need to explain the situation, Forename.\nBut before you can answer my question, I must ask: what became of Master Garlond?\nHe was one of our most skilled Generals, and one of the few who commanded respect from his subordinates. It would be a great loss if he were to be cut down in his sleep, let alone his body.\nIt would be far better if you could locate him and confirm his death.\nI should hope the memories of our meeting will suffice to explain his absence.\nIf you can spare a moment, I would ask that you search for Master Garlond's body in the fields to the north.\nIt may not be the last we see of him, but at least we now know he was not slain in our battle with the Empire."]

Title: A Bold Decision
Dialogue: ['\nRafold:', "\nI had the honor of being acquainted with Lord Haurchefant before he became Lord of Ul'dah. I was impressed with his intellect and his leadership qualities, but I also saw him as a strong-willed man with a strong passion for the role. I can hardly imagine the man who succeeded him is the same, however─and that is where you come in. You are familiar with the Fen–Yll brand, aren't you? I should imagine it is well known that the royal family owns it, as does the city–state of Ul'dah. The question is, what did Lord Haurchefant have to say about selling it to a foreign power? He clearly had strong feelings about it... As you might imagine, the matter was not easy for him to broach. But in the end, he made the decision that was right for the company, for the realm, and for Il Mheg. It was a difficult one, to be sure, but I think we have made the right decision.\nThat said, I am not entirely convinced that this was the right decision. There are a number of reasons I think it was a mistake.\nTo begin with, the company's actions could have been construed as a violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.\nIf the company is found to have acted in a corrupt fashion, then it could be liable to pay a fine of up to five thousand gil.\nEven if the company is found not to have committed any crimes, if the Crown decides that the actions of the individual responsible were corrupt, then the company could be subject to a fine of up to one thousand gil.\n...And yet, even if the company is found to have acted in a manner not considered a crime, the decision to allow the sale may still be subject to review.\nEven if the decision to allow the sale is ultimately yours, you may still wish to consult an expert.\nIf you wish to speak with a taxonomist, speak with Franchemontia at the Maelstrom. You will find her just outside this building.", '\nFranchemontia:', "\nWelcome to the Maelstrom, Forename. If you would be so kind as to show your─\nOh, I'm Franchemontia. Ah, yes, I suppose you are the one who requested that I attend you.\nLord Haurchefant was worried about the Fen–Yll brand. I understand how difficult it can be to sell something that has been declared a royal treasure, but the man had a right to be concerned.\nWhen the matter was brought to my attention, I agreed to act as a taxonomist for the occasion. I will be doing just that, if you would be so kind as to show your papers to me?\nYou will be pleased to know that I will be accepting payment in the form of scrips.\nPlease take this as a token of my thanks. I would not have been able to give you this if it weren't for your help. Now then, I must be off─it is nearly time to— Hm? Where are my manners?\nOh, you are still here. I hope that you did not encounter any trouble.\nThe sale of the Fen–Yll brand will allow us to reduce the amount we pay in import duties. It will also free us up to fifteen thousand gil to spend on other goods and services.\nI should imagine that the amount of gil that will be freed up will be enough to put any worries about the future aside. I wish you the best of luck in your decision.\nNow then, I must return to my duties. If you would have me wait while

Our search unearthed nothing of note, however, which could indicate the existence of a third chamber.\nConsidering the manner in which the heretic gathered his fellow heretics and the degree to which they aligned themselves with his goals, we may have reason to believe that the chamber is indeed empty.\nIf our suspicion is correct, then Lord Vauthry is most certainly aware of it. Given his wealth of experience, I am not surprised that he would be.\nBut forgive me, Forename. I would not be surprised if you discovered your way to the third chamber on your own. Were there an empty chamber, I would be most grateful if you could locate it for us.\nIt would be a travesty to lose Lord Vauthry, one of our most gifted alchemists. But we cannot allow him to fall prey to the heretics' seduction.\nIf you locate the chamber, please return and inform us of your find.", '\nZlatan:', "\nI see... Then the chamber is indeed empty.\nWell done, Forename. By your selfless sacrifice, you have proven yourself an ally of Ronka, and a friend of Haldrath.\nIndeed, your efforts have served to raise the spirits of all within the Coerthasian Exarchate. I do not doubt that you will one day be of service to the Scions again.\nUntil the day we meet again, friend."]
