Dialogue: ['\nFalkbryda:', "\nHm? You're not Forename? Or are you...? Ah, but of course! I'm Falkbryda, a ward of House Haillenarte, and a ward of House Durendaire.\nWe have a mutual acquaintance─a gentleman by the name of Lord Drillemont. Lord Drillemont, as you well know, is the proprietor of the Brass Blades and the Brass Falcon. He is a man of great pride and honor.\nHe is also, I believe, a man of great pain. I would be grateful if you would take this bottle of his poultice and place it before my lord. As for the poultice itself, I would ask that you fetch it from the Brass Blades.\nLord Drillemont is an old acquaintance of mine.

As I understand, she's recently come to the Brass Blades in search of a new life.\nShe has been a ward of House Durendaire for many years now, and has never left. She's a bright young lady, and I'm sure she'll make a fine ward.\nBut I must say, I've never seen her so...well, radiant. It's clear to me now that she's a ward of House Durendaire, and that she's come to the Brass Blades in search of a new life.\nIt's a pity she's come to the Brass Blades in the first place. It's not a house I want her to be a part of─it's a place she's come to know too well.\nI have a feeling she'll take her leave soon, and I hope her friends will join her when she's done her duty.\nBut I can only hope. I hope Lord Drillemont will be as forgiving as Lady Falkbryda herself.\nI must say, I've never seen her so...well, radiant.
