From this, we can formulate a plan to attract more of their kind.\nWith this in mind, I set about researching a new method for attracting the creatures. I eventually came across an interesting theory.\nThe theory states that, as they are wont to do, the apas utilize a sense of smell to locate their favorite food.\nWhile this is indeed a valid method, I believe it to be overly reliant on the senses of men. For this reason, I devised a system that utilizes the appendages of my fellow men.\nUsing this new system, I was able to catch the creatures nimbly and without mercy.\nNow, you may be wondering why we would want to employ such an unproven method. The answer is, of course, money.\nWith so many of the creatures dying in their thousands, it is difficult to find any who are worth hunting. Thus, I felt it would be a worthwhile endeavor to gather information on my own.\nMy plan is to lure out the apas using this new system, and after a while I will be able to capture a few of their kind.\nOf course, I will require something in exchange for my services. As I am sure you have observed, a single animal can have a tremendous impact on the forest.\nIn this case, I will be relying on you to gather a certain herb.

Goblin metalworkers of some renown in Idyllshire, apparently.\nAccording to Regana, despite the material requiring the use of some sort of special forge, she was able to negotiate a reasonable agreement. It still struck me as rather a lopsided deal in their favor, but we have little choice but to take her word for it...\nFor our part in the bargain, we've been asked to procure two varieties of mechanical parts. They must be of the highest quality if we are to appease the goblins' discerning eyes.\nSupposedly, the parts in question are commonly found in an apparatus employed by the Illuminati as well as the Empire's forces. We've been asked for compact springs and axles, as well as a variety of ball joints.\nI should point out, of course, that it is entirely possible that the parts we've been asked for are not the very same as those used by the Illuminati. It is, after all, the same goblin who once wielded the hammer of the Goblin High Command.\nIf you wish to make your way to Idyllshire and inquire with the goblins themselves, I would suggest speaking with Gelfloz, the proprietor of the House of Splendors. He can guide you through the transaction.", '\nGelfloz:', "\nAye, I'm Gelfloz. What brings you to Idyllshire, adventurer?\nAh, the reagent.

She was waiting there, of course, but did not say she would be accepting it at the moment.\nShe was more forthcoming with details, however. She told me that the goblins require precision and consistency in their parts, and that any part that fails to meet these standards must be discarded.\nGobbie parts are readily available, but you will likely encounter resistance from the Illuminati and their sympathizers. It is, after all, the work of an engineer, and their sympathizers are not exactly known for being kind and generous.\nI can only imagine the anguish felt by the goblins when their precious weapons are no longer needed.\nI will see to it that the parts I've been asked for are delivered to their rightful owner. May your journey back to the House of Splendors be safe and swift.", '\nZlatan:', '\nWelcome back. Regana was not herself, but she was able to provide us with the necessary reagent. It seems our deal with the House of Splendors was not as cut and dried as they would have you believe.\nFor the manufacturer, this is but another step in securing the future of Idyllshire. For you, it is yet another chance to make a name for yourself as an engineer.\nYou need not make your way to Idyllshire to acquire the parts we've been asked for.

Please, bring them to me.', '\nMortal:', 'Ah, yarzon shells. I have been awaiting your return.\nYou see, these are the shells of a yarzon. Used to prepare dishes, or simply to spice things up, yarzon shells are ever sought after.\nMight I ask you to prepare another batch of yarzon shells? The batch I just gave you was enough. Now, please go and distribute this among the people of Voeburtenburg.\nThe folk there love spices. If there is anything that we pixies can't cook, it would be hard to find.\nWhenever we go to Voeburtenburg, we are always treated to fresh yarzon shells. It would be a shame to give up our favorite food, but freshness is all that is left to us.', '\nGraceful Nu Mou:', 'Ah, you have returned. I hope that the mortal was not unimpressed with your gift.\nI see, I see... So the mortal was not unimpressed with your gift. That is well, for it means that you have given him something that he could use.\nHowever, yarzon shells are not all that are made from the yarzon. There are other, more unusual spices that are used in place of yarzon.\nMight I ask you to prepare another batch of these, just in case? In the meantime, I will deliver the spices to the mortal at Camp Drybone.\nThank you again for preparing this gift. I hope that the mortal will find great use for this gift, and that it will bring it great joy to the both of us.']
