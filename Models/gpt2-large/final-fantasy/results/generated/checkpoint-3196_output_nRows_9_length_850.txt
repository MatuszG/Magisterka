Dialogue: ['\nTataru:', "\nSo you're Forename Surname. I was hoping to speak with you about a job I was asked to take on.\nIt was a simple one: slay a group of hippocerfs for a reward.\nI was asked to slay hippocerfs in the Central Shroud, and I did my part. The hippocerfs were easy enough to spot, and I had the advantage of knowing them well.\nBut as I progressed through the Central Shroud, I came across hippocerfs not only more numerous, but also hungrier.\nI thought it best to hunt the creatures one at a time, and I dispatched my first hippocerf in eastern Thanalan.\nThe creature was a bit of a coward, however, and ran off when I tried to approach it. I was able to take it alive, but it cost me my chance at the reward.\nI wasn't sure what to make of the hippocerfs I'd slain, but one thing is for certain: they're no more.\nI realize what a waste it was to kill a creature only to have it run off. But I also realize that killing one is only half the battle.\nI hate to have wasted my chance, but I'd like you to have this. It's a small token of what I hope to accomplish with my work.\nPlease accept this as a small token of what I hope to accomplish with my work."]

Dialogue: ['\nGiott:', "\n'Twas on the eve of the Battle of Carteneau, nigh on five years ago. I was stationed here, aye, but I was also part of the first unit to be conscripted into the imperial army. We were tasked with destroying a castrum dell'arte, a piece of artillery that was used to devastating effect in the initial battles of the Carteneau Flats.\nWhen it was finally abandoned by the garrison, we were the first to receive word of it. I was among those who ventured into the ruins that fateful day, and it's been since that day that I've been haunted by the sight of that blasted cannon.\nIt's something of a miracle that I've managed to hold on to my old unit despite all of this. Aye, we were the first to be conscripted, but even we knew it would come to naught if we were all slaughtered in battle. We knew it would take time─time that I alone could not provide.\nBut thanks to you, however, I can at long last put those darkest days behind me. For having been there for me when no one else was. For helping me to overcome all of those hardships that no one else could.\nYou have my deepest gratitude, Forename. Ever shall I cherish the memories of our time together.\nTo make it worth your while, I'd like you to have this.

Through their eggs we were able to trace the sylphs' migration routes, and thus our species was born.\nTo ensure their continued survival, the sylphs' blood is piped into giant veins in the Greatwood. Our species' existence thus far has been solely based upon this blood.\nHowever, it seems some have found a way to siphon some of the blood out of the giant sylphs, and thus their kind have ceased to be.\nThis is why the sylphs of Little Solace have been so important to our work. Without their cooperation, we wouldn't be able to study the sylphs at all, much less understand them.\nYou see, one of the sylphs, Maral, was born with a defect that prevents him from properly absorbing the sylph blood.\nWithout the blood, his body simply doesn't─can't─add the necessary amount of nutrients to grow.\nIt's been a great burden, but I understand it's only a matter of time before he is no longer fit to work.\nBut I want you to know, Forename.

They can be quite dangerous when rampaging, and should not be kept in captivity for extended periods.\nNevertheless, I would be forever in your debt if you could slay three of the beasts.

Dialogue: ['\nKomuxio:', "\nI'm glad to see you again, Forename! It's been some time since we've met.\nYou seem eager to continue your studies, and I share your passion for music! As an instrument, however, I cannot compete with the likes of the lyre.\nThat's not to say I cannot learn to play it, of course. Just this day I bought a new harp, and I've been trying to learn the tune of it.\nI'm sure you've heard the refrain before: “Only through song can man know peace.” Well, I believe I know what you mean─that peace can only be attained through the performance of music!\nSo I intend to practice all the ways I can, and in the meantime you should teach me the tune!\nNot only will it help me with my studies, but it's a wonderful way to end the day!\nRight! Let's begin at once!\nHm? What's that look for? I said I was going to practice!\nRight, then. I'll just get my harp ready, and then I'll get to work!\nRight. I need you to stand right here, listening to me harp! This tune is called “The Sound of a Melody Made Easy.”\nPracticing makes it easier, doesn't it? In fact, it's the very reason I wrote it!\nI first learned the tune when I was learning the lyre, and I've been playing it ever since. It's a wonderful tune, one that anyone can play, even those with limited musical talent.\nIt's composed of two parts: the first part is a simple melody that any child of man can play, and the second part is a more complex variation that only an expert can produce.\nIf you want to learn the tune, you must practice both parts at the same time! It's as simple as that! Go on, then─show me what you can do!", '\nPop:', '\nYou sense a hostile presence!', '\nKomuxio:', '\nHm? You want to hear the tune?\nNot a problem, of course! I shall give it to you at once!\nThe Sound of a Melody Made Easy is a wonderful tune that any child of man can play. Just learn the two parts at the same time, and you will have no difficulty!', '\nKomuxio:', "\nIt's been a while, Forename. Have you been practicing?\nOh, thank goodness! It's a great pleasure to see you again. It's been a while since we last met.\nWe have so much to discuss, and I'm sure you've had your fill of thinking. If you have a moment, I would like to hear what you have to say.\nSo, what did you think of the tune?\nOh my, it's a lovely melody! I'm sure all children will enjoy it.\nThe melody is simple, but complex in the same way that a poem is. Each line has a certain feeling that goes along with it, and the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.\nChildren grow accustomed to the same melody as they grow, but they will grow bored if it's repeated day after day.\nIt's important to have variety in our training, and I'm glad that you gave me this opportunity. I look forward to hearing what you have to say.\nYou grow more skilled at playing the lyre as you get older, and that's just a fine thing!\nAs an instrument, the lyre is not the most impressive thing I've ever seen. But to have the chance to master such a fine tune, to share it with others─it's something I'm very happy to have.\nNow I just need to get back to practicing, and I hope to have the opportunity to

We want to make Gridanian life better, too─for our own citizens, of course.\nFor this, we must grant citizenship to those who were not born here, and continue to train them to take their place in the nation.\nI can think of no better way to do this than through trade. We want to encourage folk to move here from across the realm, and make our nation a place where they'll want to call home.\nThat's why I'm so excited to hear about the people you meet along the way. Thank you for helping to bring these two worlds together!"]

Dialogue: ['\nAlisaie:', "\nHow very good it is to see you again, Forename!\nIt was so long ago that we first met, in the ruins of Thanalan. It was there that I first made the acquaintance of Master Cid.\nWe eventually became acquainted with each other through our respective fields of research. It was through his research that I became acquainted with the concept of metamorphosis, and how it might apply to the study of beast tribes.\nUpon completing my dissertation, I attended the prestigious Ph.D. program at the Faculty of Medicine. It was there that I began to think of how metamorphosis might be applied to the study of beast tribes.\nAfter earning my degree, I continued to research and write on the subject of metamorphosis. Eventually, I came across the term “transformation.”\nWhile exploring the concepts of metamorphosis and transformation in my research, I came across a passage which brought to mind an idea I had long held.\n“If we can somehow capture the essence of a transformed being, we might be able to use it to our advantage in our fight against the sin eaters.”\nAlas, we know little of this phenomenon, despite its well-documented occurrence in nature. It was only when I learned of the existence of a being with the same power that transformed me that I began to think of ways to study it.\nAnd so I embarked on a research endeavor to see if the concepts I had developed could be applied to the study of beast tribes.\nI began with the concept of “metamorphosis,” and came across a passage which described an experiment in which a transformed being is exchanged for another of the same type.\nThe exchanged being is said to possess unique abilities that are best utilized when in a more “normal” state.\nI set about searching for these types, and eventually came across those which I deemed to be most useful. I set about creating a new concept for this new entity, and soon came across the concept of metamorphosis.\nAfter much deliberation, I decided to apply metamorphosis to my experiment. I set about writing the laws of metamorphosis into the beast tribes' documents, and began conducting research.\nWhile conducting my research, I came across a passage which explained the true nature of metamorphosis.\n“If we can somehow capture the essence of a transformed being, we might be able to use it to our advantage in our fight against the sin eaters.”\nIt was then that I had an epiphany. If we can somehow capture the essence of a transformed being, we might be able to use it to our advantage in our fight against the sin eaters.\nThis revelation came as a complete shock to me. I had always believed that metamorphosis was a mere phenomenon that could be exploited for our benefit.\nBut where there is a will, there is a way! I knew then that I had found the one thing that would make metamorphosis truly worth while.\nMy discovery came in the form of a “brave deed of courage.” I set forth with a mind to prove my courage, and to that end set about gathering the necessary materials to carry out my metamorphosis experiment.\nAnd though it took me a long time, I was able to put the discoveries I made into practice.\nIt was during this time that I came across an interesting theory.\nAccording to this theory, certain weapons and armor serve to increase the wielder's natural abilities. By exchanging the possessed abilities for other types, we might be able to improve our fighting techniques.\nIf you wish to try your hand at this, you might like to speak with the people of Lost Hope. They are quite knowledgeable about the subject, and I daresay they would be happy to assist you.\nIn any case, I am glad that I was able to help you with your met

Not only are they docile in the presence of man, but they thrive in crowded conditions.\nAs such, they're ideal subjects for the breeding of experimental subjects, such as you.\nIn fact, you've just returned from a short but arduous journey to the northwest─a journey which began when you purchased your first chocobo.\nIt was on that journey that you came upon the experimentatorium. Though you've since seen fit to return here, it's always a pleasant surprise to return to the place where your trials began.\nWhy, it's even been said that the people of Eorzea have a soft spot for the breed.\nNot that I need to convince you of that. If you've a mind to give it a try, what say you?\nOf course, you'll need to provide the proper facilities for the chocobo. This is no simple task, and I cannot promise that you'll be provided with the proper assistance.\nBut whatever you do, do not forget to visit the experimentatorium.

The only way to stop this threat is to cull the roaming packs, but I'm not so sure I have the expertise required to do so.\nIf you are willing to put your skills to the test, I would ask you search for and destroy three packs of traveler. Try to take them all out before returning to me.", '\nBriardien:', "You've already faced a pack of traveler? Excellent work, sinner! Now, I believe you've proven yourself a capable adversary.\nThe Crystarium is home to countless species of life, many of which have struggled to adapt to the harsh environments of outer space. Some even went so far as to create their own star.\nWhile we are blessed to live in such environs, it is the duty of every living creature to take care of its own needs─no matter how seemingly trivial they may be.\nI pray that you will one day be able to lend a hand in keeping these star-bound critters in good working order."]

Dialogue: ['\nKomuxio:', "\nGreetings, honored guest. If you have a moment to spare, I would ask a question.\nYou see, the frozen tundra that used to be the domain of the kobolds has been claimed by a faction within the Children.\nTheir leader, Mutamix, has sent a vessel to the Crystarium to petition the Crystal Exarch's aid.\nIt would seem his faction is not content with letting the kobolds continue their own affairs. They would like nothing more than to see their frozen lands reclaimed.\nIf you are willing to lend your aid to this cause, I ask that you speak with Mutamix on the fore. He will be along shortly.\nI also ask that you ascertain the whereabouts of the vessel that is bound for the Crystarium. The leaders of each faction will be present, and it would be best to let them know what is to become of their frozen lands.", '\nMutamix:', '\nWhat news do you have of the Crystarium?', '\nMutamix:', "\nAh, yes. The kobolds have been scuttling about like angry jackals. They are no more.\nI feared as much. It is good to see the kobolds on the defensive, but we cannot allow ourselves to be disheartened by our defeat. We must redouble our efforts to retake the Crystarium.\nIt will not be an easy task, but we have the element of surprise on our side. If they plot to seize the Crystarium, we will know it.\nI shall send word ahead to the Exarch, that he may prepare for the worst. I pray for your victory."]

Dialogue: ['\nBertliana:', "\nI fear this means the end for the brutish lot. I pray it is not irreversible.\nWhile I cannot spare the time to join you in your search, I would like you to have this.\nIt is a trinket taken from one of the many beasts that roam Amh Araeng. You will find it near a tree with a large horn protruding from its top.\nI would be ever so grateful if you could place it in a similar location where you found it. I cannot hope to find this creature on my own. Please do what you can.", '\nBertliana:', '\nWere you able to find the creature?', '\nBertliana:', '\nOh my, this is much more than I could have hoped for. Thank you so much.\nThe horn is a valuable prize. I shall give it to you as a token of my gratitude.\nWhen the Amh Araeng was first settled, its people used it to mark territory. However, they soon learned that it could also deliver them into combat.\nTo combat this threat, the Amh Araeng developed various weapons and armor. However, it is all but lost to history.\nIt is only thanks to the aid of the craftsmen and miners that this armory is still in working order.\nIt would be a shame to let it fall into disrepair. I hope you can find some use for it.']

Dialogue: ['\nMiah Molkot:', "Hail, Forename. I am pleased to inform you that you have a new task for me.\nI sent word to the Crystarium a while ago, but received no reply. My suspicion remains untested─how could the Elder Seedseer have sent only one envoy?\nIt would mean a great deal if you could obtain a copy of the communiqué. I would be most grateful if you could deliver it to Guntmar at the Adders' Nest.", '\nGuntmar:', "Aye, I heard from Molkot. She's doubtless busy preparing for the auguries, but I've a feeling she might have a wee task for us.\nThe communiqué contains a summary of the findings of the synergetics' investigation, as well as a request for additional experimental subjects.\nI've a feeling you'll find some suitable specimens in the Cthonic Horns. You'll find the critters docile enough when provided with a quietudeful feed.\nWhen you've a look at the synergetics' report, I'd be grateful if you could deliver it to Guntmar along with the communiqué.", '\nGuntmar:', "If you're keen on trying some of these new creatures out, why not try feeding them some tranquillisers? They should be more than a match for the more aggressive specimens.", '\nGuntmar:', 'Wonderful! The tranquillisers are found in the Cthonic Horns, just outside the entrance. Give them a few moments to settle down.', '\nGuntmar:', "The synergetics report back from whence they came. Let's see what they have to say.", '\nGuntmar:', "Oh my, what a peculiar way to express your sorrow. Did you actually request an experimental subject?\n<sigh> I suppose we could simply ask them to describe their findings in greater detail. That way, we might learn what drives them.", '\nGuntmar:', "You're a clever man. I don't doubt you already know this, but the synergetics' report contains a wealth of new information. Let's see what you have to say of it.", '\nGuntmar:', 'Much and more has been revealed in this communiqué. Let me know when you have more to add.', '\nGuntmar:', "Quite a list, my friend. Quite a wealth of new knowledge. All of it worthy of a thoroughgoing symphony.\nAnd yet, here is the least they can offer you. They only asked for a summary of the findings, not a detailed catalog. Why, that's like asking a salesperson for a detailed description of a new car!\nBut that's neither here nor there. If you're keen to try some of these new creatures out, why not try feeding them some tranquillisers? They should be more than a match for the more aggressive specimens.", '\nGuntmar:', "The synergetics' report contains a wealth of new information. Let's see what you have to say of it.", '\nGuntmar:', "Much and more has been revealed in this communiqué. Let me know when you have more to add."]
