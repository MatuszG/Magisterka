Dialogue: ['\nBriardien:', "\n'Twas on the eve of the Battle of Carteneau, nigh on five years ago. I was stationed at the Observatorium. The battle began, and I remained there until the enemy was driven from our position.\nThough I returned victorious, the battle was far from a simple one. We were pitted against a foe that would tear a garrison apart with the ease of a wooden spoon.\nAnd though we fought well, the price we paid was dear. Many of my comrades were wounded, and for a time I could not perform my duties.\nThough I remain proud to have served our nation, the thought of abandoning my post and wandering the wilderness with naught more than what I had before is utterly unthinkable.\nBut I have faith that one day my wounds will heal and I will once more take up my sword to meet the challenges we face.\nThank you for watching over me during that time.

They know it well, yet they refuse to give it back.\nThey have made us work long and hard for what we have, yet they refuse to give it back.

Dialogue: ['\nAlys:', "Traveler, please lend an ear to my tale. I've a most remarkable report to share with you. A contingent of the Crystal Braves was dispatched to the southwestern region of Paglthod.\nIt is there that they found a young girl, Alys, who─rather surprisingly─appeared to be in fine health.\nThe Braves sent word to the inquisitors on the off chance she had traveled far. Alas, it turned out that she had been taken prisoner by a tribe of Vundu.\nAccording to our records, this is the first time a Vundu has taken prisoner a Crystal Brave. We know little and less about the Vundu tribe, but it does not take a genius to recognize the threat.\nI fear the girl may have been subjected to some manner of mind control. But even should the Vundu have gained access to her memories, what recourse would she have? She is a child of the Twelveswood, after all.\nWould you travel to Paglthod and speak with Alys? I would like to know what has become of her sister.", '\nAlys:', 'I have received word that the girl is being held in the Vundu stronghold. Pray journey there and see what you can learn of her sister.', '\nAlys:', 'I have received word that the girl is being held in the Vundu stronghold. Pray journey there and see what you can learn of her sister.', '\nAlys:', "Ah, there she is. I take it you have an inkling of what happened?\nI see... It seems both sisters are in good health.\nThe Vundu's traditional method of keeping prisoners─and this is where the prisoner-to-be meets her sister─is to have them face off in a sparring match.\nIn the past, such matches have been fought on sacred grounds, meaning the victor is often granted a vision of their fallen compatriots.\nWhile it is not known how the match began, it is likely that the sisters traded blows so fiercely that their hair began to rise on their heads.\nI'm told that in the aftermath of their contest, both girls sobbed openly.\nWhile it is not uncommon for prisoners to display uncontrollable emotions, it would seem both girls are displaying erratic behavior.\nIt has been a long road, but I would like to thank you once more for saving Alys's sister. Please accept this as a token of my gratitude."]
