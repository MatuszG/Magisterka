Dialogue: ['\nLalai:', "\nHmmm... I can't see a way to persuade you to help us, but if you're so inclined, I could give you some advice.\nOne of our new creations is the “pollinator.” Think of it as a plant that can pollinate other plants.\nWhile it's capable of this feat, its creator reckons it's too simple to do so on its own.\nThat's where you come in. The creator has a certain herb which can be harvested from the bumblebees that settle in Flowerport.\nShould you take the pollinator to Flowerport and obtain some of its herb, you can use it to create a stronger, more specialized bumblebee.\nOnce you've created a suitable specimen, bring it back to me, and I will see to training it.\nI can think of no better assistance for a novice botanist such as you.\nNow, the creator is expecting another delivery, so if you'd like to keep your reward, you should leave the bumblebee creation in my capable hands.\n", '\nLalai:', '\nYou're back!

Dialogue: ['\nThubyrgeim:', "\nWell met, Forename. Thanks again for the gil. I'm sure you're eager to learn more about the relic, but I fear we've already been given the short end of the stick.\nThe truth is, while the weapon itself is impressive, its wielder is equally as impressive.\nYou see, the relic's capacity for channeling aether is incredibly high. Indeed, the mere thought of shattering a piece of crystal is enough to send most ordinary men into a frenzy, buckling their bodies and sputtering for breath.\nBut for Thubyrgeim, it's all about taking the weapon apart and seeing what secrets the soul of the weapon has left.\nThere are only so many hours in the day that I can spend poring over the ancient texts─there's no substitute for actually doing the work.\nWhich is why I am so excited to be able to share with you such a unique find!\nI must warn you, however, that this isn't going to be like some jaunt into the Labyrinth of the Ancients.\nThere will be no minor annoyances! Everything you need to know will be explained in excruciatingly painful detail.\nI fear I'm going to have to impose upon you for the first lesson, but I promise you'll get your money's worth out of it.\nI've collected the necessary materials to build a new body for the weapon. For this, we will need to split the soul crystal in two, each half of which will house a key that will open the another gate.\nYou'll need the weapon's core to do the work. I've marked the locations on your map, along with the materials I need to make the repairs. Do take care when carrying it.\nNow, before we begin, I need to make sure that your weapon is perfectly functional. I want you to hold it in your hands so that it can tell me if the gates are functioning properly.\nIf the weapons are working properly, then the soul crystal inside the weapon will resonate with the aether in the wielder's body. If the crystals are damaged, however, the wielder will be unable to enter the next stage of the relic's creation.\nI should mention here that the process of recovering your weapon's soul crystal is irreversible.

It is a small settlement that prides itself on its heritage and history.\nYou are doubtless wondering why we would choose a place so named.\nIt was named that way by a man named Manderville, who was born in the Manderville area.\nAfter his family moved to Ul'dah, he kept the old name, but he changed it to Manderville in order to distinguish himself from other refugees.\nIt is a small, humble, and very proud town that has stood the test of time. It is where many soldiers and their families have made their homes.\nIt is also home to one of the oldest universities in Gridania, the Manderville Students' Guild. Students from all over the realm come to study under the watchful eye of our professors.\nAll of these things make it a wonderful place to call home.

Dialogue: ['\nTaynor:', "Welcome, friend, to the Thalassai! I am Taynor, a humble servant of the Order of Nald'thal.\nI speak not of my wondrous robe, for I am neither a master nor a servant. I am but one man─one man alone─whose well-being is the measure of an Order which prides itself on compassion.\nIt is for this reason that I am here: to care for this one man, and see his well-being grow stronger. And yet, as you can see, I am hardly the one doing the looking.\nNot that it is easy, mind you. There is much and more I could attend to if I were given more time. I would simply ask you to wait upon my master.\nI thank you for your help. I shall now teach you the ways of the Thalassai.\nIn the name of the Blessed, grant me your ear. I shall now proceed to explain the ways of the Thalassai.\nThere is a distinct difference─a difference that can be learned, but which must be experienced to be grasped. It lies in the mind.\nTo understand the Thalassai, you must first become acquainted with the concept of thought. How do you think, friend? Do you think with your mind, or your heart?\nIf the mind is to be our guide, then it must be receptive to the feelings that flow within it. If the heart is to be our guide, then it must be receptive to the feelings that flow without it.\nFor example: if you are to make a delivery to the House of the Fierce, you would do so with your heart set on delivering the package. If, however, your heart is set on retrieving the package, then you would do so with your mind open to the possibilities.\nThe Thalassai, on the other hand, would see you as a tool. A tool which has the power to bestow blessings upon the recipient, but which cannot bestow them unless the recipient is receptive to its powers.\nThe recipient of the Thalassai's blessing is the one who receives it. In other words, the recipient of the blessing must first be willing to accept the gift.\nNow, how might we go about att

Indeed, the sin eaters you defeated earlier were not the first of their kind.\nNevertheless, the sin eaters you defeated were not the only obstacles standing in your way. As you have proven yourself, however, you are not easily defeated, and so I am confident that we can come to an understanding of what it is we desire.\nNow, let us return to Ishgard and resume our preparations for the trial.
