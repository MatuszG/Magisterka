Dialogue: ['\nTataru:', '\nWell met, Forename! Thanks to you, the creation process is now complete!\nThe instrument you forged for me─the pinnacle of my craftsmanship─is now complete! I can finally present it to you.\nIt was my dream to create an all-new Allagan creation, and with your help, it has come to fruition!\nThis Allagan relic, the Flame of Reunion, was created to combat the Fiend's fiercest foes.\nIts crystalline core is home to a crystallized incarnation of the aetherial entity known as the Allagan Warrior─an Allagan warrior who has sacrificed his life for his nation.\nWith the Warrior's crystal in place, the aetherial entity can freely resonate with other Allagan relics, granting them their properties.\nIts unique ability, however, lies in its ability to transfer certain types of aether into living creatures.\nThis phenomenon, known as resonance, has been instrumental in the creation of many Allagan artifacts.\nAs an Allagan, it is my responsibility to oversee the creation of all new Allagan relics, but I am also keenly aware of the potential dangers that await should we fail to properly control our creations.\nThus do I thank you once again for your assistance. Please accept this as fitting payment for your contribution.\nWith much gratitude, I shall continue to work on the Flame of Reunion. Please accept this as fitting payment for your contribution. With much gratitude, I shall continue to work on the Flame of Reunion. Please accept this as fitting payment for your contribution.", '\nTataru:', '\nI trust you are satisfied with the outcome of the endeavor? Should you ever wish to expand your knowledge of Allagan technology, I would be at your service for as long as this hobby continues!']

It was damaged in a car accident some time ago.\nI used some of the metal from repairing our windmills to repair the car. It's the only way I could make ends meet after my other work has taken so much of my time.\nI'm sure you've heard this before, but we Elves live long, and it's not easy for us to put food on the table.\nThis horn is a reminder of that.

Dialogue: ['\nZlatan:', '\nWhile we are grateful for your cooperation, there is yet one more area where you must deliver us your resolve.\nNorth of here lie the Circles of Eld, where the Elder Seedseer and her attendants once nurtured the starry garden.\nAccording to ancient legend, the great wyrm Hraesvelgr resolved to entrust the guardianship of this sacred land to a single individual.\nFor many years, this individual was known only as the Guardian of the Eld. But after the fall of Nym, it was revealed that he is in fact a giant of eld, the Source of All.\nFor years, the Elder Seedseer and her attendants have longed to hear his voice raised in battle. To no avail. But now, at last, they may at last hear his voice call to them from beyond the grave.\nYou are to travel to the Circles of Eld and deliver a petition to the Guardian of the Eld.\nMake your way to the Circles of Eld, and deliver a petition to the Guardian of the Eld.\n', '\nGuardian of the Eld:', "\nI am loath to trouble you, but I must. If I do not, the Elder Seedseer and her attendants will lose faith in me, and I will lose my place in the Greatwood.\nTell me true: have you heard the voice of the one who guards the guardianship of this sacred land?\nYes, I am he. And as you have heard me, I am not easily deterred.\nI will not forsake this cause, and I will not forsake my duties.\nMay the Greatwood be blessed.\n"]

A mixture of pungent extracts and succulent extracts.\nThe mixture is given to the chocobos so that they may rest, but also so that they do not become completely unworkable.\nChocobos are extremely clever birds, but they have their limits. For instance, they cannot fly when dosed with too much of this mixture.\nIn fact, I once had a similar situation where we gave them a medicine to revitalize them. The medicine worked wonders, but the bird promptly flew off into the distance.\nBut I digress. Thank you for training my chocobo. Please accept this as a reward."]

Title: A Brief Reprieve
Dialogue: ['\nLaniaitte:', "\nAh, Forename. I was hoping you'd come along.\nAs you may know, the Amalj'aa and the kobolds have been at war for generations.\nTheir skirmishes have claimed the lives of countless soldiers, and countless civilians. It is a war that continues to this day, and continues to plague our borderlands.\nThat is why I, along with many others, have been working to bring an end to the war, and have established a new settlement to the north.\nThough our efforts have been largely successful, there are still many nags and hollies that need our attention. I would like you to help in that endeavor, if you are willing.\nMy comrades and I have set aside a number of districts that are still in need of ridding. I ask that you make your way to these districts, and clear away any nags that you find. I will join you once I have completed my task.", '\nPop:', '\nYou sense a hostile presence!', '\nLaniaitte:', '\nWelcome back, Forename. I take it you have cleared away all the nags?\nIt is a great relief to see the area returned to the way it was before the Calamity.\nThe settlement we established here was built to last, and it is a testament to our determination that it has survived this long.\nI am proud that we helped make it what it is today, and will always be grateful to you for your aid. Please accept this as a show of gratitude.']
