I will not deny you the honor of a task from my purse, even if it means I have to beg for it from you myself.\nI was on my way to the markets when I received word that my brother had been taken. I rushed to his cell in the dungeons─which is where you must have come from, seeing as you are both of the same blood─and found him, ducking in a corner. He was taken into custody without so much as a word from his captors.\nMy brother is a craftsman with the Black Wolf Cartel, and his work is recognized by all the merchants in Ul'dah. To have him taken without so much as a word is a deal more than extortionate. It is a crime!\nI know how this must seem to you. But our brother's profession means everything to us. He would not have been able to commit such a crime if not for the protection of the people of Ul'dah. And you, my friend, are the only one who can ensure his safety.\nI want you to track down his guards and demand that they surrender him.

Pray come to us again when you have learned a new technique, so that I might teach you something new. And perhaps you will be able to perform the deed again, even if it is only in name?\nReturn and tell Taina what you have done. Pray come to us again when you have learned a new technique, so that I might teach you something new. And perhaps you will be able to perform the deed again, even if it is only in name?\nAh, yes─and this is the very technique you learned at the Iron Feast. Thank you. You may not have heard of it, but it is one of my favorites.\nBegone from me, then. I would not trouble you with more than a phrase now."]

In my experience, the prisoners love their wine and are loath to part with it─especially when it's been kept for their own use.\nIt isn't the first time. Last time was quite some time ago.\nI don't doubt that you've heard the stories, but there's no telling what the prisoners might be willing to part with if it means the freedom of Eulmore.\nI'll not pretend that my offer is any different. I'm merely offering what the prisoners are willing to part with for the chance to win the Garlean war machine's favor.\nYou may recall that I sent word to the Wailers that there'd be an auction. The Wailers are doubtless loath to allow their prisoners to participate, but they have no choice.\nI knew that even if I had to resort to using the auctions, at least the wine would be mine to offer.

Dialogue: ['\nHugubert:', "\nAh, Forename! I've been awaiting your return.\nYour reputation precedes you, Forename, and it is by your selfless actions that the Order of the Twin Adder has been blessed.\nYou have not chosen your path merely for the sake of fulfilling a whim or whimpering to a lover. No, you have chosen to dedicate your life to the service of the Eorzean Alliance, and to that end, you have served admirably.\nYou have made a noble and courageous sacrifice, and in so doing, have earned the right to call yourself a “Renaissance Man.”\nNow, though it is but a trifle compared to the valor shown, I would beg of you a favor─a favor of a more personal nature. A request that may well put your life in mortal danger.\nYou see, the other day, I found myself in the market place, minding my purchases, when I caught sight of an ancient relic I can scarce believe I have never seen before.\nI knew immediately that it was something of an ancient relic, for it was far too small for its size to be the product of any ordinary thief. I immediately turned my back on the item, and ran away.\nWhat I did not know at the time, however, was that the thief was a Serpent of the Seventh Dawn─the very same Serpent you seek to slay.\nNeedless to say, I was not long for my dear life when I returned─I was tossed into the Brume, where I have lain recuperating from my injuries ever since.\nWhile I have yet to fully regain my strength, I am confident I can make progress, and would be most grateful if you could procure the relic for me.\nI am certain I will be able to make up for the loss of my senses with further training, but if ever you should have need of a similar relic, pray do not hesitate to use it.\nLastly, I ask that you place my life in your hands and give her that which she may never get again. Rest assured in the knowledge that she will be relying on you, and that you have the strength to protect her.\nI pray that you will be able to find the strength to carry on, and that Hugubert will be able to look upon you with the same joy I have known him.\nI should hope this will suffice to set my mind at ease. Pray accept my humble offering, and accept this as a token of my gratitude."]
