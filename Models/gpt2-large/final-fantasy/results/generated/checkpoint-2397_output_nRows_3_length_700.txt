Dialogue: ['\nU'tykhatia:', "\nI've been studying the techniques of our forebears, but it's clear that my efforts have not gone far in improving their fighting techniques.\nThat's where you come in: you've proven yourself more than a match for even the most accomplished of our ancestors. You have my thanks!\nMayhap you can help me by providing me with a plan for dealing with a hive of wasps that have recently appeared near the ruins.\nThe wasps are a common sight in the Twelveswood, and I've seen them lumbering about on several occasions. I've tried to make a plan of attack on my own, but I'm afraid I've run out of time.", '\nU'tykhatia:', "\nYou are not familiar with the wasps, I see. I was hoping you might at least give me a heads-up on the movements.\nOnce the wasps have sighted you, they will come in a swarm to rendezvous with their hive. I suggest you split up and attack four of them at once.\nBy using this information, you should be able to plan your approach without having to resort to direct confrontation. You may even find that you can't defeat them all. If that's the case, I suggest you consult with a veteran of the wasps' tribe before you begin your assault.", '\nU'tykhatia:', '\nThe wasps are no more? Wonderful! I have another task for you.\nIn order to gauge the strength of the wasps, I want you to retrieve four pieces of crystal from the ruins.\nThe crystals can be found in three locations around the ruins─on the ground, near the wasps themselves, and in the nest.\nThere should be no difficulty in finding them, but you may need to break the wasps' defenses in order to find them.\nI will gather the wasps and see to it that they are slain. We then proceed to discuss our next step.']

Dialogue: ['\nMogok:', "Ah, adventurer. It's good to see you─and your adventuring friends─in Moogle's honor.\nAs you know, we moogles live and breathe for mooglekind. One of the many reasons we do so is because the moogle race is one of the most popular and enduring entertainment creations in all of Eorzea.\nBut it's also important that we maintain a healthy relationship with the local wildlife. And I believe a new strategy is in order.\nTo this end, I'd like to ask you to help us prepare a new nest for the moogle race.\nThe creatures that nest in the Central Shroud─the gaunt and feathered varieties─are so numerous that it would be nearly impossible to survey them all.

Dialogue: ['\nAlphinaud:', 'I must confess, though I may be of different blood, I am deeply moved by your tale. I am reminded of a story of mine from my youth─a tale of war and salvation.\nIt was during my time as a soldier that I came across a young girl playing the flute. She was beset with pestilence, and in the throes of her agony, I stepped in to help her.\nIt was then that I realized the girl had been born with a gift─a gift of the wood, if you will. When I handed her my baton, she took up its handle with her tears streaming down her face.\nNow, it may not be the most original of stories, but the sentiment evokes a powerful memory, does it not?\nNow, if you would indulge me, I would like you to perform a sacred song for the girl in my stead.\nA song that would bring comfort and solace to the bereaved.\nIn the days before the Flood, the Lambsong Doman tribe was plagued by an epidemic of grief. In the throes of this despair, a child found a leaflet bearing the message “The Lambsong have you to lean on.”\nThis leaflet served as a call to arms, and the children of the tribe rose to the call. Soon the whole village was under the sway of the Doman people, and the Lambsong were a proud and triumphant people.\nIn time, the tribe's unity was broken, however, by the advent of the Flood. Many of the young men and women who rose to the call have since turned their backs on the tribe, and those who remained loyal have given up their arms to join the fight.\nYet though their ranks have grown thin, the Lambsong remain a proud and valiant people. For this, they are in constant need of the aid of the Scions of the Seventh Dawn, my friends.\nThe girl you seek is somewhere in the eastern highlands. Please find her, and perform a sacred song for her in my stead.', '\nNanamo Ul Namo:', '\n...I am troubled.\n...I am troubled.\n...I am troubled.\n...\nI am troubled.\n...\nI am troubled.\n...\nI am troubled.\n...\nI am troubled.\n...\nI am troubled.\n...\nI am troubled.\n...\nI am troubled.\n...\nI am troubled.\n...\nI am troubled.\n...\nI am troubled.\n...\nI am troubled.\n...\nI am troubled.\n...\nI am troubled.\n...\nI am troubled.\n...\nI am troubled.\n...\nI am troubled.\n...\nI am troubled.\n...\nI am troubled.\n...\nI am troubled.\n...\nI am troubled.\n...\nI am troubled.\n...\nI am troubled.\n...\nI am troubled.\n...\n

Dialogue: ['\nRakitt:', "Ah, <Clickable(<If(GreaterThan(PlayerParameter(52),0))><Player's Grand Company Rank>)/> Surname. I trust you've completed your task?\nVery good.\nBy virtue of your service, I hereby grant you access to the Anima Singing Stones.\nBut know that the path to enlightenment lies not just through the stones, but through the soul of the one who wields them.\nWe can never truly call upon the power of the anima to grant us our needs, for such power is something we ourselves have created.\nBut as you have already experienced, we must strive to attune ourselves to the aetherial currents which guide our every thought, word, and deed.\nAnd so it is that I would ask that you partake of a gift─an instrument of grace.\nThe one I speak of is the flute.\nIt is a gift of the wood nymphai, blessed to grant both song and melody. It is also the means by which we can commune with the anima.\nThe elementals within us are bound to our fate, and so it is that the elementals' will is invariably borne by the elementals themselves.\nThus when the elementals grant us song, we are given song. When they grant us melody, we are given melody. And when they grant us both, we are given a gift that is both song and melody.\nThe elementals are ever at our beck and call, and so it is that we must respond to their call.\nIn this way, we find our way to the source of our power, and thereby our salvation.\nKnow that the path to enlightenment lies not just through the stones, but through the soul of the one who wields them.\nWe can never truly call upon the power of the anima to grant us our needs, for such power is something we ourselves have created.\nBut as you have already experienced, we must strive to attune ourselves to the aetherial currents which guide our every thought, word, and deed.\nIn this way, we find our way to the source of our power, and thereby our salvation."]
