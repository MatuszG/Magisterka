I trust you are enjoying your atma–infused relic?\nI pray it does not disappoint.\nNow, while your newfound might may indeed be impressive...do not mistake it for invulnerability. Nay, the very fact of your mastery of atma has allowed you to more effectively channel the dark arts.\nAs a consequence, your attacks have suffered no small amount of decline. Indeed, the more potent your weapon, the less effective your attacks─or so we believe.\nFor your next challenge, I would like you to demonstrate your newfound aptitude for combat by slaying an atma–infused enemy.\nI would have you pit yourself against a specimen known as an “atma–eater.”\nThese creatures dwell near the ruins of Radz–at–Han, and are known to draw their energies from the statues that adorn the ruins.\nShould you slay an atma–eater, it should not prove an insurmountable challenge for a practitioner of your arts.\nWhen last we met, you were still struggling to gain access to your weapon's full potential. It is good to know that your training has paid dividends.\nIn fact, I believe your latest performance has earned you a place among the greatest of masters in our history.\nTo further demonstrate your progress, I would have you pit yourself against another of the atma–eater's brood.\nThis time, however, you will face an opponent more suited to a practitioner of your art.\nThe creatures are known to feast on the souls of their foes, and will likely summon their forces at the very moment you face yours. Prepare yourself well for the battle ahead.\nI pray that your triumph will serve as inspiration to you, Forename, and set you on your new path. May it bring you great honor."]

Have you caught my fish?\nOh my, this is wonderful! Thank you so much.\nThis will make a wonderful main course, and I'm sure you're wondering why I need it so badly. Well, I'm going to boil the fish and then mix them with sambusa grass for a creamy stew.\nIt's a simple dish, but it's quite nutritious. You might be wondering why I would even bother to cook it in a pot? Well, I believe in giving back what you've received─and the fisherman in me wants to give back a little.\nI'll be sure to take advantage of the sambusa grass when I can. Thank you again, and have fun fishing!"]
