I'll need you to head north to where the road branches off, and look for a dried-up log.

Thanks to you, I was able to find a new life for us here in this strange land.\nI used to be a maidservant to Lord Vauthry, but things changed after the Calamity. I was sent to the Brume, and while there, I fell in with a traveler. We were able to forge a friendship, and I came to share my knowledge with him.\nWhen I returned to Slitherbough, I told him the reason I left, but he didn't believe me. He insisted I return, and we walked the path together.\nThe two of us walked the world, and in each other we found a way to make our dreams come true. We hoped that sharing our knowledge with the world would bring us closer together, but...\nAt some point, I lost hope. I thought of giving up, but then I found myself in a place where I could share my knowledge with others─and now I'm here. I hope you can find use in me, friend.\

If you've a moment, I could also use a hand sorting out the mess from under the bridge.\nThe prisoners were penned in there for a reason, and it isn't going to be easy sorting out the mess from under the bridge.\nSome of the prisoners were able to escape, but the rest are still holed up in the cells.\nI'm certain you're up to the task, but I'll require you to search the cells for anything of import.\nI'm not sure exactly what you'll find, but I'm sure you'll find something that'll allow us to communicate with our friends in the outside world.", '\nKomuxio:', "\nYou'll find the prisoners in question in the cell to the north. Nothing in there is of much value, but we can make use of what you find.", '\nKomuxio:', '\nSo, what did you find?', '\nKomuxio:', "\nA letter? This is of no use to us, but it could be of use to the prisoners.\nWe haven't been able to contact them in quite some time. Hopefully this will bring them some much-needed relief.", '\nKomuxio:', "\nIt's from their families? I didn't think they would be able to write letters, but at least their families are getting some solace in the knowledge that they're still alive.\nHopefully this will also bring them some much-needed relief. I suppose this is it, then. I'm sure you'll be wanting this."]

Dialogue: ['\nLaniaitte:', "I know all about the “resistance.” I've been on both sides, and seen it with my own eyes.\nBut I can't help but worry, Forename. If the Garleans are so determined to destroy us, they may very well succeed.\nAnd if they succeed, we may well be forced to relive the horrors of the past.\nForgive me, Forename. I won't keep you from your task. All I will say is that there is still much to be done.\nI would be most grateful if you could deliver this letter to Kyokyozo, my commanding officer.\nKyokyozo is stationed at the Observatorium in eastern Thanalan. Let him know that I am ready to assist the Resistance forces should they wish it.", '\nKyokyozo:', 'A letter from Laniaitte? Aye, I knew it. But what brings you here?\nAh, Forename. I trust you were able to secure the aid of my men?\nThey wish to take Castrum Abania from the Empire, you say? That is a bold plan, to say the least.\nWe are not without options, Lord Commander.\nWe could seize the airship and fly it into the skies over Castrum Abania, or we could wait for the Garleans to come to their senses and withdraw their forces. But we would be fools to do so, knowing what they would do in the face of such a large-scale invasion.\nEither way, we must ensure that the Resistance forces are ready to defend their holdings should the time come.\nAnd I can think of no better partner to assist us in that endeavor than you, my friend. Pray convey my greetings to him, and give him my best regards.', '\nLaniaitte:', "Kyokyozo is counting on you, Forename. And I can hardly imagine what he would have to gain by employing you.\nBut he is right to worry. For the time being, at least.\nI'll keep the matter in suspense, but I have one last favor to ask of you.\nIf you are successful in securing the aid of my men, pray convey my thanks to Kyokyozo. That will be all, Forename.", '\nKyokyozo:', "I know all about the “resistance.” I've been on both sides, and seen it with my own eyes.\nBut I can't help but
