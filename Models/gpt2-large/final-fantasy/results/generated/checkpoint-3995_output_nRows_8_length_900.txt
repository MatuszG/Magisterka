Dialogue: ['\nGildon:', "I'm sure you've had your share of dealings with Rowena's Raiders, but I'm told this one went even further than that─she actually struck a deal with the devil!\nAccording to the scoundrel, he and a dozen other men were conscripted by the Dravanians as mere cannon fodder!\nHe even claims to have served in the Empire's army, though that's pure baloney. He was promised food, and instead he's cashed out on his own countrymen.\nHe even goes as far as to claim he wasn't actually conscripted, but rather made a deal with the devil to get what he couldn't get on his own.\nIf this is true, then Rowena herself may be in grave danger. She's been known to call in favors from beyond the grave, so any deal she makes must be done with full knowledge of the consequences.\nBut of course, that's where the problem lies. For whatever reason, the scoundrel refuses to talk, and I'm not certain if I can trust him with anything more than a cursory inquiry.\nIf you could locate this scoundrel and have him come to me, I would be most grateful. I can think of nothing more useful than having a sympathetic ear.\nI can't imagine Rowena would be keen on a man who's openly bragged about his crimes, but perhaps her men will be more amenable to negotiating a less draconian arrangement.\nIf you can find the man, ask them what they would propose in exchange for his silence.\nThey won't bite, I'm sure, but might be they won't be so cooperative either.\nIf you can't get the man to talk, try offering this up as a token of contrition. That seems to have worked.", '\nGildon:', "I can't imagine Rowena would be keen on a man who's openly bragged about his crimes, but perhaps her men will be more amenable to negotiating a less draconian arrangement.\nIf you can find the man, ask them what they would propose in exchange for his silence.\nThey won't bite, I'm sure, but might be they won't be so cooperative either.\nIf you can find the man, ask them what they would propose in exchange for his silence.", '\nGildon:', "Good to see you returned safely.

I can see now why they described him as a demoniacal warlord. He truly is one of a kind, and deserves a place of honor in any den of sin.\nThat's not all I have to offer you, though. Allow me to share with you the rest of my findings.\nYou see, I was able to glean some valuable information about Rowena's Raiders─information which could prove pivotal in my investigation.\nIf there's one thing I've learned about the Dravanians, it's that they're not so different from us here─victims of circumstance. They too have suffered at the hands of those who would do them harm.\nAnd after speaking with these men, it has come to light that not all of them were actually forced to take up arms against their will. In fact, some came to see the necessity of joining the fight against the Empire.\nIf our countrymen are truly so cravens as the scoundrel claims, then bargaining isn't so futile as they'd have you believe. Perhaps there's even some benefit to be had in joining the Dravanians' ranks.\nMy research is far from finished, but I hope you'll consider making a deal with the devil in your future endeavors. It may even prove to be a mutually beneficial arrangement!\nOh, and before I forget, I'd like you to have this. It's a token of my thanks, and will hopefully prove to be a valuable addition to

Dialogue: ['\nAlphinaud:', "I have no doubt that Alexander will make a fine knight, but he will need more than swords to make that possible.\nHe will need a well-trained bodyguard, and I believe that the best available are the dragonsworn dragoons of House Durendaire.\nThis city has long been the stage for the battles between the Holy See and the Dravanians. The Holy See won't take kindly to any foreign armies staging here, and the Dravanians won't take kindly to any foreign armies staging here, either.\nSo it is that House Durendaire has forged an alliance with the Resistance, creating a force that can protect Ishgard from Dravanian attack.\nTo that end, the House has forged an agreement with the adventurers' guild, granting them exclusive use of Ishgardian-made weapons and armor.\nNow, I know what you are thinking: this is all very well and good, but why would the House of Splendors consent to allow dragoons to use Ishgardian arms?\nThe answer is simple: money. House Durendaire is a wealthy house, and it simply cannot afford to foot the bill for every knight who takes up sword and shield.\nEven if it did, what good would it do to arm the dragoons with weapons that were made in theocracies of other lands? What good would it be to have them fight under our flag?\nFor a man of your stature, Lord Dragoona is well aware of the answer to that question. And so he has made his decision.\nBut there is more to this than meets the eye. House Durendaire is home to many a heretic, as you would expect. And while we may have made an agreement with the Resistance, there is still the matter of the heretics' arms.\nThere was a time when the Dravanians held sway over all of Ishgard. That was before the Flood, and House Durendaire will not cede that power to the Resistance.\nIt is an uncomfortable truth, but the House will not cede that power to the Resistance either.\nThere is but one way to earn your keep, my friend: you must prove to the people of Ishgard that you are the equal of our knights.\nThat will be your trial, and it will be an important one. Do you accept it?\nVery well. You will take up your sword and shield, and strive to become the equal of our knights.\nYou will need to earn your keep fighting, and that is why I have asked you to take up your weapons and armor. When the day comes that you have proven yourself worthy, I will grant you access to our exclusive weapons and armor.\nThis will not be an easy task, nor will it be an easy decision. But I trust that you will make the right decision for you."]

I've heard you delivering the goods, too, Father?\nThank you both for making the delivery. The church is a place of refuge for us Virdjalaites, so any time the imperials tried to march us off to the slaughterhouse, we'd have to fight to the last man.\nI don't suppose you've heard, but not long ago we found one of the Garlean soldiers hiding in a cave near the church. He was wounded, but didn't have long to live.\nIt's a good thing he was able to flee...if he had been captured, I'm sure he would have ended up like my son.\nIn any case, I'm grateful to both you and the Carpenter for helping me return home safe."]

Dialogue: ['\nVarthon:', '\nHave you come to join the others on the southern front, Forename?\nThough my duties have kept me here for the most part, I have heard tell of the carnage wrought in battle by enemy soldiers and their warmachina.\nIndeed, the imperials often prefer to wait until their intended target has been weakened before sending more troops to deliver the final blow. Yet for all their cunning, they are remarkably predictable.\nLet us suppose you destroyed one of their warmachina, and the enemy receives word of your victory. They would no doubt assume the effort has left you exhausted, perhaps even badly wounded. A perfect opportunity to send reinforcements and overwhelm you.\nBut what if, unbeknownst to them, we are prepared for the arrival of these additional troops? It would be an opportunity to further diminish their ranks.\nI should hope it is not far-fetched to imagine the Empire sending at least one of their forces to the borderland at this time. I will make what preparations I can, you being a soldier of the Resistance.', '\nVarthon:', "\nIt should not be long now before they return, and I hope you are ready for their arrival.", '\nBartholomew:', '\nAh, Forename, just the man! Your victory has earned you the respect of all at Falcon's Nest.\nIndeed, it has earned you the sobriquet “Lord of the Hosts.” No doubt the name is familiar to you, for it is the title he once held.\nBut let us not dwell on the man. What matters is your triumph in the face of overwhelming odds. You have shown us that the Garleans can be defeated, and made us proud to be Garlean.\nThat said, there is one more obstacle standing in your way─the matter of proving your strength.\nI would have you escort me to the Rising Stones.\nThere you will meet my comrade, Sothton. He will tell you of your achievement, and of the purpose for which this band is dedicated.\nYou need not hesitate to follow me.", '\nVarthon:', '\nBartholomew, I have told you of your encounter with Sothton.

You have told me much of your encounter with the Empire.\nThey sent you to Falcon's Nest on purpose, I see, to slay you and confirm your defeat.\nClearly, they had high hopes for you and your allies, but your defeat has them doubting their plans.\nAnd now they seek to take you and your comrades prisoner.\nWhile I would not dream of doing such a thing, there may be other ways in which we might contribute to their cause.\nIf you are determined to oppose them, there may be a way to win your freedom.']

To this end, I present you with this hat, which I trust will serve you well.\nNow then, to begin with, may I ask you to take this commission─a task from my hat?\nSurely, you are aware that a hat is the unit's primary means of identifying and preserving the unit's history. Thus, I am certain that you have already seen the importance of this garment in your travels.\nIndeed, this hat is everything that I am and everything I wish to be. Made with softest, most luxurious wool, it is the finest piece of equipment the Archers' Guild has ever bestowed upon its members.\nNow, I trust you have grasped the concept? Good. Now, let us move on to the task at hand.\nNow, I trust that you are familiar with the concept of precedence. At its most basic, precedence is a matter of who has done what before.\nPriority is thus a matter of who has done what in the past. Thus, for the sake of efficiency, all members of the Archers' Guild are expected to carry out regular reconditionings, be they physical or mental.\nThe concept of precedence is, however, particularly important to you, for it allows you to carry out your duties with efficiency and aplomb.\nIn carrying out your duties, you will be making certain that you do not conflict with any members of the Archers' Guild who are present and wish to receive of you.\nBe it ever so important that you maintain focus and concentration during your reconditionings, I must remind you that it is not always possible to perform at your best.\nThat said, it is your duty as an Archers' Guild member to strive for such perfection. Thus, in performing your duties, you may well find yourself seeking inspiration, as well.\nThat is all I have to offer you. I hope that this hat will suffice as your entry-level hat.\nNow, I trust that you understand that reconditioning cannot be accomplished without first obtaining the necessary materials.\nIf you would have the opportunity to procure any additional materials, I would be most grateful if you could bring them to me.\nSince I am in a position to judge your performance, I would also ask that you observe me whilst I perform my duties. Do not hesitate to do so, now that I am the one assessing your performance.", '\nMarielle:', '\nI trust that you have gained a basic understanding of the importance of precedence and the reconditioning process?\nGood.
