You've just made a fantastic bargain, lad.\nYou see, the House Dzemael knights agreed to pay a handsome sum for you and your compatriots' help with the restoration of Ishgard.\nAnd that's the story. The truth is, many years ago, some nobleman─I forget whose─asked me if I could spare a single knight to do the work.\nI said, “Sure, if you need the coin, I can get it for you.” And sure as day, the answer came back in the form of a massive sack of gold!\nOh, but don't you dare tell anyone.

It turns out that a number of our knights were poisoned during the Calamity.\nThey were taken to the Holy See in the wake of the disaster, where they received treatment which─by and large─took their lives.\nThey were given a choice: take the life they had worked so hard to build, or die trying.\nAnd it was for that reason the House Dzemael knights offered you their services─to ensure the safety of their fellow citizens.\nBut that's not all. They were also paid handsomely to ensure that the Holy See would remain in one piece.\nAnd for that, they were rewarded with lands and titles.\nWhen you speak with them, they will all swear that nothing was ever said or done behind closed doors. They will tell you that it was a mutual agreement, and that the price was fair.\nAnd that, my friend, is the story of the bargain you struck.\nThe Holy See is in no position to comment on any private agreements between its citizens.\nIf you want to know more, you'll have to seek the counsel of the knights themselves.\nBut don't worry. You won't be the first to try it. The Holy See will welcome any and all who are willing to put their lives on the line for Ishgard's restoration."]

Thank you.', '\nTroubled Beekeeper:', '\nI am relieved to see that you removed all of the flowers.
