Dialogue: ['\nGildon:', "Word travels fast in Limsa Lominsa. I gather from your expression you are not from around here.\nI am Gildon of the Admiral's Spire. Know you the Brugaire Consortium?\nIt is a trading organization that brings together the finest merchants and artisans from across the realm in order to create a more prosperous Limsa Lominsa.\nIt would not be possible without the contributions of the many small merchants who ply their trade within our city. I am certain you will see them represented here, lending their talents to the cause.\nI should also mention that recent events have left our coffers somewhat depleted. It has not been easy keeping the Consortium afloat during these trying times, but I assure you that your help is greatly appreciated.\nIf you are ready, I will brief you on the particulars of the deal you are about to make.\nI knew I could count on you, Forename.\nThe Admiral's Spire is well known for its fine artisanship, and this group of merchants has the opportunity to add to that list.\nIn return for their goods, the Consortium has agreed to supply the Lominsan forces with provisions and clothing. The agreed upon price is very reasonable, and you have no reason to doubt its value.\nI should point out, however, that this agreement does not cover the procurement of weapons and armor. Limsa Lominsa is a nation with a long and rich history, and we cannot allow ourselves to be drawn into a war between our allies.\nThat is why I have asked that you seek out General Raubahn at the Octant. He will be glad to give you an overview of the situation.\nGeneral Raubahn should be found just inside the doors. Seek him out, and do not hesitate to call upon him if you have a question.", '\nRaubahn:', "Well met, Admiral. I am Raubahn, and who might you be...?\nAh, Forename Surname! Just the man I was hoping to see!\nAs you may have heard, the Admiral has asked that we supply the Lominsan forces with provisions and clothing.\nThe price we have agreed upon is quite reasonable, and you have no reason to doubt its value. Indeed, it would not be a wise decision to draw our forces into a war with an ally of Ronka.\nBut what is this? Your friend here claims to have a question─what might that be about?", '\nRaubahn:', "Ah, yes. I suppose it would be best if you would excuse me. General Raubahn will be waiting for you outside the doors.\nGeneral Raubahn will be waiting for you outside the doors.", '\nGildon:', "Welcome back, Forename. General Raubahn has been waiting for you. I trust the general was able to give you an overview of the situation?", '\nRaubahn:', 'It is good to finally be able to put a name to your initiative. And I say “an initiative” because for all intents and purposes, you are now a member of the Consortium.\nBut what are we to do with you? You are a free man, after all, and we cannot force you to join our ranks.\nYou have made the right decision, and I hope you will be willing to carry out the orders of our commander-in-chief.\nGeneral Raubahn has been waiting for you. I trust the general was able to give you an overview of the situation?']

Dialogue: ['\nTatafu:', "\nGood evening to you, sir. I'm Tatafu, a servant of House Fortemps.\nYou wish to visit the brothel, yes? I am pleased to provide you with an opportunity to do so.\nYou see, House Haillenarte has recently been charged with the maintenance of the Lydha Lran, an ancient temple dedicated to Rhalgr, the first of our ancestors. Our lord has been charged with overseeing the restoration of this once-proud temple, which stands at the heart of the Dravanian Horde's invasion force.\nIt is for this reason that the House has asked that you assist our lord in his duties. I have been tasked with conceiving a strategy to draw the Horde's attention while maintaining a constant watch over its movements.\nMy superiors have already approved of your participation. I shall now proceed to the stage where you are to deliver the plan to the commander.\nLest you wonder how we can best prepare you for this task, I should remind you that our lord has already instructed me to furnish you with all the necessary weapons and armor.\nOnce you are ready, meet with my subordinate, Ser Marcelain. He will explain the plan of attack, and invite you to join us should you decide to avail yourself of it.", '\nMarcelain:', "\nWelcome back, my lord. I trust the assault on the Lydha Lran is proceeding as planned?\nIndeed it is. Our scouts report that the temple is now under blockade.\nThe Ishgardians who once resided within have all but disappeared, and the Dravanians who once patrolled the perimeter have all but disappeared, too. It will be no small feat to take the temple and secure the surrounding area, but we have the support of the Immortal Flames and the Crystal Braves.\nHouse Haillenarte is indebted to you and your companions, my lord. Let us pray that you and your allies will succeed where so many have failed."]

Dialogue: ['\nNpca:', "\nGood evening, sir. I'm a porter bound for Vesper Bay, but I've received word that the guard I was sent to watch has been conscripted by the Empire.\nI can't turn myself back now, and I know I won't stand for it if the guard refuses to leave me be. Would you be so kind as to take this letter to him in my stead?\nIt's just over yonder, to the south. Just give my name and tell him I'm conscripted.", '\nNpcb:', "\nWho are you?\nAh, the notorious “blue-eyed villain”! Well, I'm glad to be rid of him, at least for the time being.\nWhen I heard about the conscripted soldier I was sent to watch, I had a feeling I'd be next. But to have him conscripted by the Empire... I don't know how to feel about that.\nStill, it's better than being held prisoner by the Garleans. I'd rather not be conscripted at all.\nBut I suppose it's only a matter of time before the Empire comes calling again.\nI'll have to find a way to resist the calls to service, at least until I've had a chance to rest and recuperate.\nThank you for delivering the letter. I should be back at work soon. Here, take this as remuneration for your efforts."]

Dialogue: ['\nCharmion:', "Lali-ho! A moment of your time, sir. You're one of those adventurers who's made a name for himself by cutting down beasts and saving the day─are you not a man who sets a good example?\nI'm Charmion, researcher and curator of ancient Bozjan artifacts. I have been tasked with studying the artifacts found at the ruins, and I need someone to pose as a potential acquirer.\nYou will? Oh, thank you! I've already sent word to my associate in Reunion who is expecting someone─I trust you've already heard the rumors.\nThe associate has been tasked with searching for a man by the name of “Hamlet Resident.” A friend of mine in the past has a son who goes by the name of “Hurk.” I've asked Hurk to look into this gentleman's background, and I trust you will do the same.\nIf you would be so kind as to call Hamlet Resident by his name, call him at the Diamond Forge, across the hall from the Imperative.\nPlease make sure he is who you think he is, as I can't rightly trust anyone under that name.", '\nHurk:', "Aye, I'm Hurk. You are the outsider seeking knowledge of the antiquities at Bozjan?\nMy associate awaits you at the Diamond Forge. He can furnish you with the details.\nAh, but before we begin, a word of warning: the place you are about to explore is fraught with danger. Do not take too much for granted.\nIf you wish to make a name for yourself as an acquirer, it would behoove you to speak with a number of locals. If you know nothing of the art, one of these people may be able to enlighten you.", '\nHurk:', "Now then, what brings you here to the Diamond Forge?\nHah! Now that you mention it, I'm fairly certain I saw you strolling in there not a moment ago.\nNow, for the sake of expediency, I'll assume you know nothing of ancient Bozjan.\nBuzjan is a name that means “black earth,” and its residents have been described as possessing...let us say, “a dark and brooding aspect.”\nNow before we continue, I must warn you: this isn't going to be like some jaunt in the jungle.\nYou'll be expected to work with a group of fellow adventurers, and you'll likely end up fighting a lot. That's not to say you'll walk out of there a winner─there's no glory won from a scuffle with a stranger, am I right?\nThat said, if you have any questions or concerns, I would be happy to answer them.\nOh, and be sure to browse the antiquities, as there are plenty of them that need picking over.\nIf you have any questions or concerns, I would be happy to answer them.", '\nCharmion:', "Ah, Forename. You've returned.\nI trust the information you gathered was enough to convince you of the potential value of these artifacts?\nSplendid! It would seem you've proven yourself an acquirer not only with your skills, but with a knack for convincing others of the same.\nI suppose you'll be wanting this, then.\nAs you have undoubtedly noticed, much of the ancient Bozjan art is in need of restoration.\nI've set about researching what can be salvaged, and while I'm pleased with the results so far, I need someone to step in and take on the final step.\nIn fact, I'm sure you can appreciate the feeling of accomplishment you'll feel working with an accomplished adventurer such as yourself.\nWhen you are ready, pray meet me at the Imperative, where I'll be waiting to give

Normally I would assume the other party to be an adventurer─someone who would be willing to pay good coin for a good cause.\nBut to think someone so simple as yourself could be so instrumental in bringing about peace in the area!\nYou see, I was approached by a merchant looking for someone to deliver a package to a Culinarian in Falcon's Nest. Upon learning who it was, I agreed to meet him at the spot.\nAfter some searching, however, I discovered the merchant was not from Falcon's Nest but from a faraway land.

House Durendaire has long stood at the forefront of the Resistance's defense.

He did what any decent man would─he sought treatment, and that treatment led to his death.\nBut to receive a letter from a fellow knight is a great honor indeed.

I trust you are familiar with the Quicksand, my dearest establishment?\nOh, yes... You will love it, won't you, Forename Surname? It is the place where the eponymous 'Quest' was first published, and where it remains to this day!\nEver since the advent of the Seventh Umbral Era, 'Quest' has been a cornerstone of Dalamud's philosophy. It is the single most influential text to be found within Dalamud's Codex, and an unrivaled source of inspiration to all who study the arcane.\nAlas, due to the ever-increasing demands placed upon our time─and perhaps especially the advent of the Eorzean Alliance─Marielle has been unable to commit to its continued publication.\nThus, all is not lost. For while 'Quest' may no longer be fit for prime time, it is still a vital text for our discipline, and its continued availability is more than simply practical─it is essential to the continued success of Dalamud's endeavor!\nSo you see, it is not simply that 'Quest' is more than a mere collection of aphorisms; rather, its pages are chock-full of wisdom that can be applied to any endeavor.\nFor instance, one might examine 'Quest' in the light of one of Dalamud's most enduring lessons─the value of patience.\nThe patience required to complete a task is one of the most basic and enduring traits a Dalamud can display, and one that 'Quest' masterfully empowers its readers with.\nAnother passage that might serve as inspiration is one addressing the importance of defining one's goals and then pursuing them with all of your might.\nDalamud teaches us that all is not attainable─that failure is an essential aspect of our growth as magi.\nHowever, 'Quest' teaches us that true success can only be attained through the pursuit of dreams.\nThus, should we fail to fulfill our dreams, we can only learn from our failures, and thereby grow stronger.\nThis is all well and good, but what of you? Have you read any part of 'Quest'?\nOh, yes! There is a passage which deals with the value of perspective.\nDalamud teaches that the mind is a window into the world, and that seeing one's own dreams through the eyes of one's path can give rise to a more fulfilling life.\nIf one wishes to live a fulfilled life, it is essential that one looks beyond the present and looks into the future.\nIf you would follow in Dalamud's footsteps, you would do well to read 'Quest.'\nA parting thought: while I am exceedingly grateful for your interest in 'Quest', I must warn you that 'Quest' is a rather long book. I advise that you do not take your time with it. I would recommend you begin with the first volume, “The Second Umbral Era,” if you have the time!\nLastly, I would like you to know that I take great pride in teaching my students the value of patience.\nI cannot wait to see what path you might one day take you on─one day you, too, might be capable of reading 'Quest.'"]

But I will not be party to any negotiation.\nMy offer is simple: any insurgent who wishes to bury his dead can do so at my house.\nIf you've a mind to search the snow for a place to bury his remains, feel free to do so. I will not interfere.\nWhen you're done, make your way to Masher Erimmont.

Alas, not long into our arrangement, he was named as a guild defector.\nThe news was met with some dismay, to be sure, but I had no choice but to take up my sword and forge my own way.\nI understand that the decision is not to be made lightly, but I would ask that you speak with Stephanos and explain your intentions.

You are free to take your new endeavor under my wing at will.\nI am certain you will find the experience most educational. The realm-renowned blacksmith Stephanos will be your first lesson, but I hope you will also take time to hone your skills with another of his works.\nYou have much to learn, and I wish you the best of luck.\nIf you would also like to hone your skills, I would also recommend you speaking with the blacksmith Erik. He is another former member of the Ashcrown Consortium, and has created some truly masterful armors for us to choose from.", '\nRui:', "You want to forge armor for the realm's finest? Then you might want to speak with Erik the Blacksmith. He's been crafting weapons and armor for years, and was even named guildmaster by the head of the Ashcrown Consortium before that.\nIf you're in the mood for learning, then speak with him. He has a wide selection of quality wares on display, so you won't want to miss out.", '\nStephanos:', "You have learned all that you can from me, then?

I think you'll enjoy what I have to offer.\nI should mention, however, that it would not be a proper guildmaster's job to be making the decisions on who may or may not work in the blacksmithing profession.\nYou'll have to make the call on who you wish to work with, and that decision is ultimately yours.\nI look forward to hearing of your adventures in the realm's finest. Take pride in knowing that your hard work has led to a quality product that will serve you well for years to come.\n"]

I'm Ermancan, and I serve a father who has recently come to suffer a bereavement.\nMy son was born with a cleft palate, and for the past two years he's been under observation at St. Baldeo's Children's Home.\nAfter a second hearing, the father and I were told that he must have a cleft palate removed. I was given a choice: allow him to undergo the operation at my expense, or continue to live with the perception that he has a defect.\nI've made the decision, and I would ask that you assist me. If you would be so kind as to take him to the operation, I would be ever so grateful.\nThe operation is quite simple: you need simply peel back the fat from the roof of the mouth. It shouldn't be too difficult for someone of your ability.\nHere, take this tube. Fill it with the cleft palate and lower it into the incision.\nNow, I would ask that you observe the child from a distance. I realize that it may be tempting to look, but do not forget to observe from a safe distance.\nI can imagine the pain the child must feel, alone in the world without his father. I hope you can provide the sort of comfort and solace he so sorely needs.", '\nTroubled Father:', "Oh, my boy! I'm so glad you're here!\nTo be honest, I didn't think much of it at first. The operation was simply something I wanted to do for the sake of the child, you know?\nAnd then I saw the news stories. Parents like you and me are often the ones who are the first to discover a child has a cleft.\nI couldn't bear to see my boy's face growing dim with age. I know he must have thought me unfair, but I couldn't bear to see him grow up without me.\nBut now that he's here, I'm going to make sure he has a good life. And I can't do that by myself.\nThat's why I wanted you to help me. Not only will you be helping your fellow man, but you'll be helping me too. Now, let's get this over with.", '\nTroubled Father:', "Well? Were you able to see the child?\nHe's so tall and has such a lovable face. He's so kind and patient, and I'm so happy he's mine.\nAnd he's so smart, too. He's like a scholar in his own right.\nHe has a cleft in his palate, but he can't talk. He can't even open his eyes.\nI'm sure that's something he'd want to talk to you about, so let's keep the conversation going.\nOh, I couldn't have done it without you! Thank you, and thank you again. I'll see this operation to his good."]

I think it's best if you ask the question in person, since the answer could be construed as confidential.\nThe chief engineer's waiting for you outside the door.", '\nBeneger:', "\nChief, you're here at last! I've been waiting for you by the cryo-tron.\nThe Twelveswood has been in an uproar of late, and I've been tasked with fixing the problem.\nThe problem lies with the reactor's control systems. They were last serviced ten years ago, when the facility was still known as the Crystarium.\nBut then the unthinkable happened─the core of the reactor exploded, sending a hundred thousand tons of high-purity aether into the surrounding area.\nWe've no means of recovering the reactor's core, and we've no idea where it might have ended up if not for the intervention of the Scion of the Seventh Dawn.\nIf you would be so kind as to procure an aetherometer and some other necessary equipment, I will be along shortly.\nNow, before I leave, I would ask that you take care of one last task for me.\nThe reactor's core is in a secluded corner of the Crystarium. Please go and retrieve it for me, and inform the chief of my success in doing so.", '\nTataru:', '\nChief, the reactor core is in plain sight. I can see it with my own eyes...', '\nBeneger:', "\nYou've already retrieved the core? You've done it!\nMy thanks, my friend. Here is your reward for your services.\nYou may be surprised to learn that, unbeknownst to you, I have been working on a completely new reactor concept. And I would be most grateful if you were to help me test it out.\nI will be relying on you and the reactor core to prove the viability of my new reactor concept. Do take care, and I hope to receive word of your success in the very near future!", '\nTataru:', "\nYou've returned safely! It seems the chief was able to glean some valuable information from the reactor.\nThis is, of course, merely a precursor to the true transformation of the Crystarium. Soon we will have a facility that is worthy of the name─one that not only caters to the needs of the military, but one that welcomes all who enter its doors.\nAs I said, it's my dream to turn the Crystarium into a place where all who come call can enjoy peace and harmony.\nThat's why I'm so excited to hear of your contributions in the future. You're a very capable man, Forename. I can't wait to see what you'll accomplish!"]
