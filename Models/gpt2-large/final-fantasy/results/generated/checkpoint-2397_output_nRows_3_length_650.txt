Dialogue: ['\nGildon:', "\nI am pleased to inform you that your instrument has been blessed by the Keeper of the Humana.\nIn accordance with the custom, I would show you the way to acquire it.\nYou will find the keeper in the study to the east of here. Present your instrument to him and he will tell you all you need to know.", '\nGildon:', '\nWell, what did the Keeper of the Humana have to say?', '\nGildon:', '\nA blessing from the Keeper of the Humana? Why, it is as though he is already a master of the wood!\nYou see, blessed instruments are instruments of incomparable beauty. Their beauty is enhanced by the presence of a special crystal─a crystal that can change the appearance of any instrument it touches.\nAnd the crystal used in this case is the humana itself.\nIt is, in fact, one of the fruits of a forbidden fruit─a forbidden fruit that grows only on the hamsa shrub.\nThe fruit has long been considered a curse, and the Keeper of the Humana was never one to take lightly when it came to dealing with its appearance.\nBut with the blessing of the Keeper, your instrument will be transformed into something that is as beautiful as it is functional. And it is this change in appearance that is the source of its power─the power that allows you to use it in new and exciting ways.\nIn the past, such transformation was only accomplished through the use of forbidden fruits. Now, however, with your blessing, your instrument can achieve such transformation without recourse to forbidden fruits.\nNow, while you are doubtless eager to hear more, it is my hope that you will refrain from saying anything until you have received the blessing of the Keeper of the Humana.\nWhen you have received the blessing, I shall show you how to acquire it.', '\nGildon:', '\nWell? Were you able to acquire the blessing of the Keeper of the Humana?', '\nGildon:', '\nYes, everything appears to be in order. Now, as you may already know, this crystal is the key to attaining a blessed instrument.\nAnd just as you would use a piece of metal to make an adamantoise hatchet, a piece of crystal is used to make a hamsa horn.\nIn order to attune yourself to this crystal, you must do the following:\n1) Take it to the keeper in the study to the east of here, and he will show you how to acquire it. 2) Take it to the other hornmaker in the village, and he will show you how to attune yourself to it.\nSo, in summary, you will need to do the following:\n1) Take your blessed instrument to the keeper in the study to the east of here, and he will show you how to acquire it. 2) Take it to the other hornmaker in the
