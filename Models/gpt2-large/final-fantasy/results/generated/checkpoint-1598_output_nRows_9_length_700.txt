Dialogue: ['\nGaius:', '\nThank you, Forename. I have been expecting you.\nIt has been some time since I have seen a man so eager to venture into the unknown.\nTo think I had the honor of meeting you at the very moment you set out on your expedition.\nWhile it is my duty to escort you to and from your vessel, I must admit I have been in a rather foul mood of late.\nI fear I have not been alone in my fretting. I fear that your return may well have been hastened by some otherworldly entity.\nThough I fear I have no means of ascertaining the nature of this otherworldly being, I fear that it may well be of great interest to you. I know not how much, but I suspect that it may be of great interest to you, as well.\nThe other day, I received word that an adventurer had arrived with information concerning your expedition.\nI know not how much of this information is accurate, but I suspect it contains information which could very well prove to be of great interest to you. I do not doubt that it would be of great interest to you, as well.\nI ask that you speak with the adventurer and see what information you can ascertain of your own.\n', '\nYugiri:', '\nGaius sent you? Wonderful! If I may, I have a rather interesting report to share with you.']
