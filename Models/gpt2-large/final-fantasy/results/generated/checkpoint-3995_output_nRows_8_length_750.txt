Dialogue: ['\nDaimbert:', '\nI trust you are aware that a representative of the Ixal was recently spotted in East Hawkers' Alley.\nThe creature was described as being of a "cat-like appearance and was seen carrying an armful of bones. It is my belief that this was the bargaining chip used to attract a greater one.\nNaturally, we would like nothing more than to verify the veracity of this sighting, but we cannot do so on our own. As you may know, we agreed to accept a single Ixal at the bargaining table only a few short years ago.\nIt is essential that this be resolved before any further injury is caused. If you could collect the bone and bring it to me, all will be made clear.', '\nDaimbert:', '\nWere you able to recover the Ixal bone?\nYes, this is it! Excellent work.\nYou have my thanks.\nYou see, it is not easy for us to obtain the materials we need to build our structures. Those from the bodies of animals and men have been our most valuable commodity, and those we have discarded have been given to the beasts of the plains.\nI am certain the Ixal would take exception to the fact we are negotiating with them. But to my delight, they have yet to express any objection...\nAh, but there is one more item I would have you collect.\nThis time, it is a horn. Used to attract a more fearsome opponent, the horn of the gazelle is one of our most valuable possessions, and we wish to ensure it is not lost to the Ixal.\nOnce you have collected the horn, deliver it to Sandre. He will know what to do with it.', '\nSandre:', '\nDaimbert sent you to fetch me this bone?\nIt is of course the horn of the gazelle. Once we have traded the animal for its flesh, we will be able to make fine leather goods from it.\nYes, this will do nicely. Now all that is left is to trade the horn.\nBefore you go, I would ask you one question. Have you heard the tales of the beast that once slumbers beneath the sands?\nAccording to the tales, this beast is a primal, the very avatar of evil. It is said to slumber beneath the sands until the moment when all life on this world has been consumed, at which point it slumbers again, this time to the detriment of the local fauna.\nIn order to acquire the flesh of the gazelle, you must slay a primal. Do you believe I am correct?', '\nSandre:', "\nHm. I recall you spoke of a primal before. While I am not certain, I do recall that the creature you seek is described as a primal slumbering beneath the sands.\nIf you are indeed able to obtain the flesh of the gazelle, I would be most grateful if you could bring it to me.\nI am certain the beast you seek will be described as a primal slumbering beneath the sands.\nIf you are indeed able to obtain the flesh of the gazelle, I would be most grateful if you could bring it to me."]

Should we surrender even a single soldier─as we so dearly wish to─the price will be steep in both blood and treasure.\nIt has been a long road, but the Scions have made it this far.

And so, the Holy See granted permission to the Ishgardian scholar who would create such a vessel─Granson the Scions.\nI must say, I'm honored to have played my small part in this grand endeavor.\nYou may recall, the inquisitors learned of the Ishgardian scholar who would create the Holy See's airship.

The first is to use the pastry bag you bring me, and the other is to use a buttered pan.\nI'll be honest─the first method is by far the most tedious. You'll be lifting the bag, pressing it against the hot stone, and then lifting it again to sprinkle the crumbs on the pan. It's not for the faint of heart.\nThe second method is by far the easiest. You'll be ladling the hot stone and the carrot cake mixture into a buttered pan. That's it!\nNow, you may be wondering how the cake is supposed to be buttered? It's this: the carrots are cut into bite-sized pieces, and then coated in flour.\nThe carrot cake is baked in a hot oven until golden brown, so the coating takes care of any sticking or splattering.\nAnd that's all you need to know about the making of our cake! Now, I'd best be getting back to work─I'd hate to leave you waiting.", '\nLunchclerk:', "Ah, Forename! So, how was the carrot cake?

Title: A Breath of Respite
Dialogue: ['\nAlys:', "Well, well, well...if it ain't my old friend Forename. Might you be looking to secure a place of honor in the Resistance?\nA lot of folk would, if truth be told, be overjoyed to meet the man who saved their lives.\nIf you're at all keen on the notion, I'd be honored if you could make your way to the Forgotten Knight. It's not on the list for some time, I'm afraid.", '\nAlys:', "And I'll be damned if I'm going to ask you to travel all the way out here to a place they call a death camp.\nIf you've no other pressing concerns, I'd ask that you pay a visit to Master Cid. He's the one who gave me my first sword.\nI'm told he's been gone for some time─I'll make sure he knows you've come.", '\nCid:', "By Rhalgr, it's you! And who might you be...?\nForename Surname. The savior of the Resistance! In fact, I'd say you're more of a hero than a mere commoner.\nIf you come seeking the hero of the Resistance, you've come to the right place. I'm Rhalgr, the master of this place.\nWhen the Garleans first marched upon us, our ancestors offered up our lives in the fight to survive.\nWhen they took our lands and our women, we did what any decent man would─we fought back. And when they took our weapons, we took up swords and gave our lives to defend our freedom.\nI say “we,” but actually, there were several other tribes who resisted the Empire. And after Doma's liberation, a lot of them found their way here to take up arms.\nThe Forgotten Knight is a place that was home to many of them until the Empire took it all. And I'm glad to see that all is now under our control again.\nI should probably also mention that Master Cid isn't here to offer words of encouragement. He's here to tell you how you can honor our fallen comrades, and that's all you need to hear.\nI've already given you your password─if you want to get in, you'll need to answer the call. If you're ready, let me know and I'll let you in."]

Dialogue: ['\nWeary Radiant:', '\nA moment, if you would. My comrade has been gone a while, and he is likely heading north.\nWe could use a man of his skills. If you are willing, I would have you search for him north of here.\nIf you manage to find him, please tell him he can count on us. And if he proves to be weary, give him this.\nIt is nothing special, but I thought it might cheer him up.', '\nFatigued Radiant:', '\nI must say, I did not expect to find my old friend. I had thought him to be far, far away...']

Dialogue: ['\nTaina:', "I'm terribly sorry to have kept you waiting.\nThe inn is incredibly busy, and the innkeep is even more so. He has a habit of rushing off on tasks without the slightest bit of regard for the strain it places on his limited resources.\nIt's quite out of the question that I should be responsible for his ever-increasing workload, so I'm thinking I could make use of a few of his free hours. Might you be so kind as to give him a hand?\nThank you! There's a spare bed in the room to the east, should you be so inclined. I'll be waiting just outside.", '\nTaina:', "I don't suppose you've ever experienced the pungent aroma of goblin cheese? It's not exactly a pleasant one, but it's essential to our existence here.\nThankfully, it's so simple to make, you can make it yourself! All you need is cheesecloth and a cloth bag.\nI've taken the liberty of making my own bag, but you could probably use a pillow or two for added support.\nIf you're not too concerned about the texture, you could probably wrap the cloth around a few of the trees around here.\nI should mention, though, that the cloth you use must be sufficiently soft to allow the cheese to cling to your body without rifling through your clothes.\nMake sure you wash your hands after you eat the cheese, else you'll be eating it for free.", '\nTaina:', 'Have you brought the cloth?\nOh, this is just what I needed!\nNow all that's left is to ask the goblin what he prefers the look of.\nI imagine he likes a good dashing man, so I shall ask him what manner of cheese he prefers.\nHe's rather fond of the red, I must say.\nI've taken the liberty of making my own bag, but you could probably use a pillow or two for added support.\nIf you're not too concerned about the texture, you could probably wrap the cloth around a few of the trees around here.\nI should mention, though, that the cloth you use must be sufficiently soft to allow the cheese to cling to your body without rifling through your clothes.', '\nGoblin:', "What do you want?\nTaina's the innkeep, you say?\nAh, yes, I suppose she is.\nI am Gratt, goblin overseer.\nI have been tasked with managing this particular establishment since its inception.\nI take it you've brought the cloth?\nExcellent! I shall make the necessary arrangements to have it ready before the next wagon arrives.\nThat's everything from here on out. I'll be heading back to the Carline Canopy.", '\nTaina:', "Oh, you're back.\nI trust the cloth was as soft as you say?\nIn that case, I should be fine-enough-to-wear it despite the fact that I'm serving a man who prefers the look of a certain type of cheese.\nYou know, I've noticed that the people of this city seem to value fashion over all else. It's not for me to dictate what people should or shouldn't do with their own lives, of course, but I do wish more of our countrymen shared my passion for elegance.\nAt any rate, you've been very helpful.

Dialogue: ['\nAlphinaud:', '\nWelcome back, Forename. I trust you were able to find Reyner?', '\nReyner:', '\nAh, Master Alphinaud. I take it Yda and Papalymo have been helpful with their progress.\nIndeed, with your aid, they are now ready to undertake the next step in their training─the trial of the archbishop!\nI am still a little concerned about the lichkeeper's behavior, but I trust Yda and Papalymo will be able to handle themselves.\nBefore we set forth, however, I would ask that you pray for us in our time of need. Pray come to us when you are ready, my friend.', '\nAlphinaud:', "\nReyner has made great strides in his training, and I am pleased to see he is ready to take the next step.\nYou are doubtless eager to see the archbishop on your journey, so let us speak of that final trial."]
