I've sent word to Camp Drybone to have a commander take a look at the Central Shroud.\nThe kobolds will not take our territory so easily. We must be prepared for all contingencies.\nI will write this message to the other leaders at once. We must be ready to defend ourselves if need be."]

I've been working on improving the unit's performance for a few weeks now, and it was a perfect opportunity to put my new ideas to the test.\nThe unit's control module is responsible for regulating the flow of aether into and out of the weapon.\nAs you might expect, the improvement of this particular module is directly related to the improvement of the weapon itself. We've been refining the concepts we developed for the past several years, and this latest effort is our most ambitious yet.\nBy combining these concepts and advances from our earlier work, we believe we can achieve an even greater degree of efficiency.\nFor example, one of our newest advances involves using a composite material to reinforce the weapon's outer shell. This material is stronger and more durable than the standard alloy used in previous incarnations, improving the unit's resistance to damage.\nI believe this will prove invaluable in achieving the weapon's desired balance between strength and flexibility.\nIn addition, our engineers have also been hard at work on improving the unit's ability to accurately track and track targets.\nWith this in mind, I would like you to collect the experimental unit's control module for further experimentation.\nPlease be sure to collect the control module before returning to me. I will see to getting it back to you on my own."]

Dialogue: ['\nHabitat Designer:', '\nYou are interested in working with nature to create habitats for our starborn?\nVery well. I will assign you to a team of researchers to develop and implement a solution to a problem that has vexed us for generations.\nWe first encountered the concept of neotropical mollusks in the mid-seventies when we began work on the first hive. Initially, we intended to incorporate them into our design for self-sufficient habitats, but the concept was ultimately abandoned in favor of more naturalistic concepts.\nOne of the researchers, however, remains committed to the concept and continues to check its status on the progress bar at the top of the screen. Please go to her and inquire as to the status of the endeavor.', '\nRedolentrose:', '\nSo you are the new arrival at the Archeion. I take it you have your work cut out for you.\nHm? A survey of the mollusks by Habitat Designer?\nThen all is not yet lost. I shall continue to consult with the designer and see what more I can do to contribute to the restoration effort.\nI will also need you to attend to some preparation for the neotropical mollusks. They will be born from a new type of fertilized egg.\nPluck one from the nest and place it in a container with this aether-converting catalyst. When they are born, transfer the aether to the mother mollusk.\nThe catalyst is not difficult to find, but the location of the birthing nest should be kept secret. Once the neotropical mollusks are born, they should be given a good, strong incubation to help them grow.\nMake certain they are given a good, strong incubation. Once born, transfer the aether to the mother mollusk.', '\nHabitat Designer:', "\n<blip> <blip> Confirming mission status... <blip> <blip> Mission status: successful. The creator has approved your proposal. You are now free to proceed with the creation of habitats.\nThe goal of this endeavor is to provide suitable habitats for starborn of all varieties. Though it is our ultimate objective to create a self-sufficient habitat for all, we cannot do so if we are caught up in the interminable cycle of production.\nFor now, we focus on achieving a suitable habitat while minimizing our environmental impact. Achieving this goal will take much planning and research.\nI trust you have learned a valuable lesson from your experience. Please accept this as a token of our appreciation."]

In fact, we're always hoping to find a way to make use of as much of their natural resources as possible.\nSpeaking of which, I'm sure you've noticed by now that we use honeybees in our beekeeping operations.\nSome of us are more interested in using them for their pollination services, while others simply like the idea of having them around for the collecting and cleaning.\nEither way, we'll do our best to make use of them.

Dialogue: ['\nFaezahl:', "\nSo, Forename, what do you think of the new harp?\nI've been using it for a little while now, and I've learned a few things. Namely, that it's a fine instrument to play, and that it requires no precious materials to craft.\nIt would be a shame if it were to be lost, so I'd like to preserve some of its history for posterity. I would like you to take this harp and put it back into its rightful place.\nI'd also like you to give this harp a tune so that it can be properly recognized by future generations.\nIn case you're unfamiliar with the concept, a tune is a piece of music that is played by an instrument. It is meant to evoke a certain mood in the listener, so as to help the performer learn the right way to play.\nTune up the harp and then put it back where it belongs. I'd like to hear what you think of it.", '\nFaezahl:', "\nSo, how did you feel playing that harp?\nI had a feeling I was listening to a piece of music that was rich with emotion.

I hope that our musical heritage will be passed down to our children and grandchildren."]

But thanks to you, I have the confidence that I can pilot one just as well as Master Garlond.\nNow, let's take a look at what we learned about the Talos.\nSo, the Talos were created by the aetherial researchers at the Allagan Empire as a means of detecting and destroying Dravanian drones.\nUnfortunately, they were so incompetent that they ended up attacking their own people instead of the Dravanians.\nAfter being tasked with the creation, they continued to neglect their duties and even began creating their own Dravanian drones.

There are already so many that I wish I had more.\nYou're doubtless wondering why we'd ever want to study them in the first place. Well, as I mentioned earlier, collecting and studying the creatures was the main reason I got into botany in the first place.\nIt's a fascinating field, one that I'm excited to continue learning about, and I hope that you will too!\nIf I remember my father correctly, he said something to the effect of, “If you want to study something, you should first
