Yes, everything appears to be in order.\nYou see, the recently deceased wished to place a special instrument upon the grave of his beloved.  He placed a talisman upon it, which he called his 'holy trinity.'\nIt is of course, a token of the divine presence that resides within our universe. And as such, I am forbidden from possessing such a relic myself.\nHowever, as I have said, I am forbidden from touching the object. That is why I have been asked to procure a similar trinity from the Akadaemia Anyder.\nThere is a man by the name of Eustace at the Anyder who can provide you with a similar relic in return for your service. You can find him standing vigil before the altar to the east.\nPlease speak with him and receive from him the trinity I have requested.", '\nEustace:', "Yes? Ah, Fufucha bade me attend you. I am Eustace, one of the caretakers at the Akadaemia Anyder.\nTrinity or no, it matters not what you choose to do with it. What matters is that it brings us closer to the divine. A true 'holy trinity' brings us full circle, and such items are treasured by many.\nTrinity is not all about the physical. It is about the spirit that resides within each of us. When we place our trust in the divine, we are fulfilling the wishes of our souls.\nNow then, what can I do for you?\nHow should I put this? Ah, the question is rather rhetorical. I will not force you to answer, of course.\nI simply wish to confirm that the trinity you seek is indeed what he described.\nSo, what do you think? I certainly hope it is as beautiful as he described.\nNow then, let us return to Fufucha. I must gather the others and make plans for the funeral.\nI will see that the grave is properly prepared. Then I will go and prepare the akadaemia Anyder's burial vase.\nThank you, Forename. You have done me a great service today.\nAt the very least, I can say with certainty that my actions have been in accordance with the wishes of the departed. Pray accept this as a token of my thanks."]

You want to hear the tale of Woven Oath, do you? Well, I can't well tell you more, not while Grandfather's still alive.\nBut what I can say is this: the boy who would become your pupil passed through the same crucible as you, and flourished.\nNot that he was all that different from you, I'm sure you noticed...\nAnyway, back to the subject at hand. Woven Oath was a sacred instrument, used to summon the power of the elementals─a tool Grandfather was quick to claim as his own.\nOf course, being that it was crafted from consecrated wood, it was capable of slaying voidsent without end. Grandfather, being a man of his word, had it made available to him on demand.\nOf course, he could have as easily taken it back himself, but he wanted you to have it. So he went to great lengths to ensure its authenticity. He even went so far as to hire an expert to verify the boy's identity.\nWhen it was time for the guild's next apprentice─the one who would take over from Grandfather─Thubyrgeim went straight to work. He had the boy ready for the moment he walked through the door.\nThe moment you closed the door, Forename, the boy set forth to slay the voidsent. You know how it goes, you know how it ends.\nBut this time, the voidsent came not from the wood you had bestowed upon it, but from a different vessel.\nThis time, the boy set forth from his home to slay the black dragons that dwell in the depths of the Twelveswood. But the path he chose wasn't one made of wood or metal. No, this time he set forth on foot, for he had learned the value of freedom.\nAnd that, Forename, is the story of Woven Oath.\nSo you see, the lesson you've learned at the end of your journey is that there is no greater joy than wielding the power of the elementals.\nWhen you set forth to slay your first voidsent, you won't be carrying a coffer or a prayerbook. You'll be carrying an instrument, a tool, and a spirit─all of the very tools Grandfather used to craft the boy who would become your pupil.\nThat's why you'll want to make sure it's worthy of your time.

But we did not fail to make preparations.\nAnd second, it is important that we stress the importance of recovering the bodies of our fallen comrades.\nIn all likelihood, you will find that your first task will be to recover the bodies of our fallen.

I hope all's well with the guild, and I'm sure Master Gegeruju and all his entourage are enjoying the fine weather.\nThe trouble is, the guild's stores of food have been running low, and if we don't have our next shipment of ingredients, we'll be in big trouble.\nI'd be much obliged if you'd pick up a few sacks of flour and a can of tuna oil at the Drydocks. With everything else I've asked you to bring, I don't think you'll have long left!", '\nHume Lout:', "\nThe rest should be in order.

Dialogue: ['\nZlatan:', "\nAs Gerolt mentioned, we will require some manner of reclamation facility in order to restore the Aetherochemical Research Facility to its former glory.\nThe House of Splendors has been working on a solution to the atmospheric impurities at the core of the reactor, but it seems the solution may require more than simple reclamation.\nAccording to Master Gerolt, if all goes to plan, retrieving the spent fuel from the core of the reactor should be no small undertaking.\nYou are familiar with the area around the core of the Eremitron reactor, yes? Very good. Let us call on Master Gerolt to begin preparations.", '\nGerolt:', "\nReady when you are, Forename? Excellent. Everything is in order.\nThe core is no larger than a briefcase, so we should be able to retrieve all of the spent fuel without resorting to any of the more complicated methods we've discussed.\nWhy did you decide to undertake this mission, you ask? Quite simple─we simply cannot afford to delay in fulfilling our end of the bargain.\nA reclamation facility must be constructed, and if all goes to plan, we can do it without recourse to those accursed rich.\nAccording to Master Gerolt, retrieving the spent fuel from the core of the Eremitron reactor should be no small undertaking.

But be warned: if you are unable to procure the spent fuel, you will not be able to load it onto the next available vessel.\nYou may bring the fuel to the Confluence if you wish, but do make sure you first verify that the recipient vessel is able to receive it. I cannot promise that it will be immediately available, but we can provide consignment tracking services so that you may find out.', '\nGerolt:', "\nWe've completed all of the necessary preparations, and now it's up to you to get Regana to agree to let us take the core.\nUnfortunately, agreeing to let someone else take the core is not as easy as it looks.\nWhile we'd be grateful if you could bring the fuel to us, it is ultimately your decision whether or not you want to proceed.\nIf you would rather not return to the House of Splendors, there is no obligation to do so.\nPlease
