Dialogue: ['\nYugiri:', '\nWell, if it isn't Master Mutamix! How might we be of service?\nI am in need of two koban horns, which grow to the west of here.\nThey are extremely rare, and I would ask you to procure them on my behalf. If you would do this, pray speak with the local porter, who should be expecting them from the nearby village.\nOh, and you will want to make sure the horns are clean and ready to use before you carry them. I suggest rinsing them well, then storing them in a dry place.', '\nYugiri:', '\nThe local porter should be expecting the horns you seek. Make sure the horns are clean and ready before you carry them.', '\nYugiri:', '\nI trust you have made the necessary preparations? Good. Now, if you will excuse me, I must attend to my duties.', '\nMutamix:', '\nI see you have the horns, yes? You have my thanks.\nNow, if you will excuse me, I must attend to my duties.']

Dialogue: ['\nViraban:', "\nAh, my lord Forename.

Dialogue: ['\nMaucolyn:', "\nWell, that was a rather unusual experience. You see, I was working on a new piece of equipment─a double-drum harp─and I sent out a recruit to procure some hornets for the project.\nOf course, that recruit is no ordinary hornet. He is a veteran of the Maelstrom, and he brought along his own personal instrument. I have no doubt that it is the finest harp ever made─and certainly the finest harp I have ever heard!\nBut when I learned that he was away on another assignment, I feared that the hornets I had purchased might have been lost.\nBut no! They are all accounted for and accounted for! I can tell you for certain that the first time I saw the recruit, he was in the company of an Eorzean knight, and that was the first time I ever saw the recruit in the company of an Eorzean knight!\nBut─and this is the most important part─I can tell you that the recruit and his instrument are now safely stowed away in the storage area.\nI cannot thank you enough. You have done a great service for the guild. Here─take this as a token of my gratitude."]
