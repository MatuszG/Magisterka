Ah, yes, toadstools!\nI know that you are doubtless wondering just why the toadstools are of such high quality.\nThe answer is quite simple─they are of a much higher quality than the rest of the material we use.\nWhen we contract with foreign countries for the production of our weaponry, we must take into account not only the needs of the people of that land, but also those of our own countrymen.\nAnd by employing only the best materials from our own country, we are able to meet both of these objectives.\nI do hope you will find the toadstools to your satisfaction.\nNow, if you will excuse me, there is some business I would attend to before we part ways.']

The divinities favor you more than you know.\nThe flute you play is an old one, made to honor the memory of the proprietor of an esteemed café. When I first laid eyes on it, I knew no other instrument by which I might meditate.\nMy experience as an artisan has taught me that nothing is more important than the reputation of our clients. Were it not for the fine instruments I make available to those in need, I doubt I would be able to play the flute to save my life.\nNow, I trust you are satisfied with the information I have given you. The next time you see me, I would be pleased to show you my newest creation. It is a gift from my friend, Esmond, and a token of my gratitude to him.\nIt is a gift of a sort─an amaro, with horns. He serves as my conduit for the transaction of my wares, and I am honored to have him at my side whenever I make a purchase.\nI am honored to have been chosen to play the flute for so dear a soul.
