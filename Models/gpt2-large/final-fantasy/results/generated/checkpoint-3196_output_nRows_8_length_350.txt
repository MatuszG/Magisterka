Title: A Brave Resolution
Dialogue: ['\nZlatan:', '\nA resolution was reached at Nicehollow seven years ago, Forename.\nIt laid bare the tragic truth of the Calamity─the frozen tundra we know today as Lakeland.\nIt condemned us to a future we could never hope to attain─an existence devoid of hope. Yet somehow, through the power of friendship, the Alliance rallied around us, and the Lakeland we see today flourished.\nThis is an ideal we must strive for, one that we have struggled to achieve on our own.\nToday, we honor the memory of those who fell in the Calamity by creating a new nation for them, and by assisting them as they rebuild their homeland.\nOur work is far from finished, but I would like you to take part in it.\nTake part in the restoration of Lakeland by speaking with Vaincannet at the Congregation. Show your support for their efforts, and help bring about a new beginning for our people.', '\nVaincannet:', '\nWelcome to Nicehollow, Forename. What can I do for you?\nAh, you wish to hear about the restoration of Lakeland. Very well. Allow me to explain.\nWhen the ice began to build up on the shores of Lakeland, we found it difficult to access the land. We tried negotiating with the landlords, but to no avail. Eventually, we paid a visit to the Crystarium, where we found a representative of the Crystarium council.\nThere we spoke for a while, and after deliberation

Yet for all their cunning, they are remarkably predictable.\nLet us suppose you destroyed one of their warmachina, and the enemy receives word of your victory. They would no doubt assume the effort has left you exhausted, perhaps even badly wounded. A perfect opportunity to send reinforcements and overwhelm you.\nBut what if, unbeknownst to them, we are prepared for the arrival of these additional troops?\nThen, when they come to attack, we will be ready to counter-attack!\nI would ask you venture out onto the battlefield and fell two 4th Legion nimrods and two 4th Legion slashers.\nShould they decide to send reinforcements, there will be no element of surprise to favor them.', '\nDmitar:', "There should be no trouble finding the 4th Legion nimrods and the 4th Legion slashers.

But to receive such a well-crafted weapon without proper training is foolish.\nTo develop such skill, one must be constantly improving their technique.

I expect their numbers to grow in the coming days, but this much I can assure you: they will be on the defensive.\nThis front is no longer a battle between men and dragons, but a struggle between men and the ancients. We can ill afford to be distracted by their growing numbers.\nBut what of you? Are you content to let these ruins grow in your absence? I ask this as a man who has spent his life studying the ancients, not a man who has fought them.\nIf you are so eager, I will brief you on the particulars of the fight against the ancients.\nThere will be much to learn, but for now I would ask that you seek out Rhalgr's Reach in the North Shroud. There you will find a man named U'odh Nunh─a scholar of the ancients as well as one of our own.\
