Dialogue: ['\nBoy03566:', "Mortal─I've got something to ask of you, if I may. I was looking around the markets and saw these iron leg traps set up around the Bazaar. I'd love to get rid of them, but I don't want to cause any more trouble for the guards. Could you come along and get rid of them for me?", '\nBoy03566:', "You'll find the traps set up in the Bazaar. Just be sure to kill any rats that get at the bait. I'm sure the merchants will be glad to see their wares removed!", '\nBoy03566:', "The traps were set up near the Bazaar. Please get rid of them for me.", '\nBoy03566:', "The merchants will be glad to see their traps removed. I can't believe they put up with all this...", '\nBoy03566:', "Mmm... So soft! I can't believe I didn't see this before! I'd never have thought to look at an iron leg trap before, but it's so ridiculously strong... I wonder why they put up with it...", '\nBoy03566:', "Well, I'd best get rid of those traps, else they'll be set up next time. Thank you, mortal!", '\nBoy03566:', "Now that you mention it, those traps could've been set up anywhere. I can't believe they put up with it for so long..."]

Dialogue: ['\nKokosamu:', "\nAs we speak, the imperials are holding several thousand prisoners─some of them for months at a time─in dungeons and labor camps across the empire.\nThey hold the prisoners in contempt, treating them with all manner of cruelty and savagery. They even go so far as to inflict physical harm on the children of their enemies─boys and girls just behind the ear.\nTheir treatment of prisoners is so abhorrent that even our allies in the Maelstrom are beginning to speak out in protest.\nBut I fear that if our voices are not heard, the imperials will take matters into their own hands and make an example of one of their own─a boy of no importance, least of all to the Garleans.\nThat is why I would ask you to speak out for me in my stead. If the imperials should choose to make an example of him, then so be it─but if they choose to spare him, then so be it.", '\nKokosamu:', "\nI cannot thank you enough, Forename.
