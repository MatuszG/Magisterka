Title: A Beeautiful Plan
Dialogue: ['\nHirase:', '\nNow, the plan to capture them is simple, but the execution is anything but.\nFirst, we need to gather a suitable number of bees. This will be the main task of our scouts.\nThe bees are easy to come by, but the bees that thrive in the soil are not so easy to come by. The only place they can be found is in the ruins of Ushiraja, to the north.\nYou will need to search for them and collect their nectar. After you have collected their nectar, bring it here and we will have our bees.', '\nHirase:', '\nSearch for the bees in the ruins of Ushiraja. Collect their nectar and bring it here.', '\nHirase:', '\nHave you collected the bees?', '\nHirase:', '\nExcellent. Now the bees will not be able to escape.\nTo make things worse, they are not the only things that dwell in the ruins. There are also many dangerous beasts that should not be trifled with.\nYou have our thanks for all you have done. We shall take it one step at a time, but thanks to you, we may yet have our bees.']

I've been expecting your arrival.\nNow, I'll have you know that while you were away, our patrols were attacked by Garlean forces.\nThey were dispatched by a Garlean vessel─the Vindictive. And judging by the number of ships, it appears the Admiral sent you to deal with them.\nI've no doubt you're curious as to what went on, but I've not been able to gather information on the subject.

Dialogue: ['\nYugiri:', "\nYes, yes. I am happy to see you again, Forename. It's been quite some time since our last meeting.\n...Ahem. Thank you for coming. I have a rather interesting report to share with you.\nAs you may have gathered, a number of our younger soldiers have recently made the decision to join the imperial army. In some cases, they have made the decision without consulting their families.\nWhile this is a regrettable state of affairs, we must do all we can to encourage them to make the right decision. For this reason, I've written to the leaders of the three provinces that border our home─the leaders of the Three Sisters, the leader of the Yellowjackets─to ask them for their thoughts on the matter.\nAs I said, I expect the leaders to share their thoughts with you. If you would like to know more, I suggest you speak with the leaders of the provinces to the north of our home.", '\nYugiri:', "\nWe will be sharing our thoughts with the leaders of the three provinces to the north of our home.

I've heard many a tale of young soldiers making the fateful decision to join the imperial army.\nIt's clear from the look in your eyes that you are well aware of what's at stake.\nBut I imagine your comrades in the field are as well. For these reasons, I fear it may prove difficult for you to find an impartial source to relay your concerns.\nI am in your debt for your concern. If I should have any further information on the matter, I will be sure to pass it on to you.", '\nYugiri:', '\nWe will be sharing our thoughts with the leaders of the three provinces to the north of our home.

We have a problem.\nA merchant by the name of Rowena has arrived to collect the goods from the docks.
