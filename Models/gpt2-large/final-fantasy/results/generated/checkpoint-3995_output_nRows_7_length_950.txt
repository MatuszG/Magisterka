If they would be so kind as to sit down with a fellow traveler, it might be worth the time.\nIf you could speak with a member of their retinue, it might be worth your while.

In exchange for three bags of raw materials, I promised to keep quiet if you brought me one of his heads.\nI'm at my wit's end, so I'll just throw these in the river.\nDo be careful.

I could really use your help right about now.\nI was in a dark place, and now I'm going to breathe life back into my life. I promise you that.\nIf you're looking for the raw materials, you'll find them at the river.\nBefore I give you the bags, I want you to promise me you'll keep quiet. That you won't take arms against the House of Ul'dah.\nIf you keep quiet, I'll think of a way to reward you.\nAnd once I have the raw materials, I'll send them on their way to Gontrant.\nYou have my word on that.

Not until the bloody bag of raw materials is in your hands!\nNow, what is this? Some of the workers say it's the finest cloth in all of Ul'dah.\nIf you want this, you'll have to take my word for it.

I could ask for no more capable person to be my partner in this endeavor.\nNow, the Twin Adder is well aware that we are both artisans, so they have asked that I prepare the harp in question.\nIn truth, Fufucha and I began discussing the creation of this piece many years ago, when she was yet a child.\nAfter much deliberation, we decided to take the liberty of choosing a wood for the harp's body. A choice we made with great deliberation, and with the help of many experienced hands.\nThe choice was ultimately made by the sultana herself, for she is an artist herself.\nI will not bore you with the reasons why we chose this wood, nor how we went about choosing it. Suffice it to say, it was a difficult decision, and one that I hope we both can enjoy.\nNow, the harp you have just played was made from alder. Alder is renowned for its durability, and is used in many different ways.\nIn this particular case, the wood we chose is the durable bark from the palm of the hand.\nThe palm of the hand is where many of the sultans' secrets are found, and is where the sultana herself was said to choose her harp.\nSimply put, the sound of the harp you just played was inspired by the sound of the palm of the hand.\nIt is of no wonder that the sultana is so passionate about her art. It is the reason why she continues to create pieces from time to time.\nWhenever a new piece is ready, Fufucha and I are the ones who are tasked with playing it.\nI am certain that you have played the harp before, but what you may not know is that Fufucha has been training both you and the harp since its inception.\nNot only is she a master of the harp, but she is a master of the instrument as a whole. As such, I am confident that you will agree that playing the harp is an enriching experience.\nSo go on, take your harp and let your mind be your guide as you play.

Dialogue: ['\nAlisaie:', "Welcome, Forename! I'm pleased to report that both the Maelstrom and the Order of the Twin Adder are pleased to have you join their ranks.\nThis has been a busy few weeks for the High Houses of Ishgard. Countless knights have been transferred to the capital, and houses from across the realm have flocked to offer their assistance.\nEven House Dzemael, long a bastion of opposition to the Empire, has come to the aid of House Haillenarte.\nBut Haillenarte is not all united. There are those who seek to undermine the Holy See, and House Dzemael has heard their messages loud and clear.\nTo such an extent, I understand that the Holy See may need the assistance of foreign armies. But I would ask that you humor the notion that your presence here might be construed as an invitation to war.\nYou may have heard that we are coordinating our efforts with the Scions of the Seventh Dawn. I would ask that you pay your respects by way of a display of military might.\nYour presence today is but one small step in the greater plan we have for the liberation of Ishgard. We shall make this a campaign that shall be fought to the last man, and I would see you join the effort.\nI would be most honored if you could join me in the field by way of a ceremonial escort.\nThe procession will begin at the Church at Dammroen Field.\nWe shall commence our march from here at once.\nForename─we would have you escort the Holy See to its new home.\nSpeak with Master Gerolt at the church to register your plans. I will join you as soon as I am able.", '\nGerolt:', "Well met, sir. I take it Alisaie has told you the details of the mission already.\nWe've been waiting for you, Lord Commander.

You will then proceed to the Adders' Nest, where you will meet the archbishop.\nI would suggest you take the time you need to make your way to the Adders' Nest. We can wait here until the marshal arrives.", '\nAlisaie:', "Yes, I'd like to accompany you too, but we've reserved a place for you and Master Gerolt at the back of the procession.\nSpeak with the nunel at the church to reserve your place.

A far cry from the barracks I shared with the knights of House Durendaire, I'm sure.\nIn truth, I fear that our plans may have changed since our last meeting.\nWhile we continue to coordinate our efforts with the Scions, it has become clear that not all of them share our vision for the liberation of Ishgard.\nThat is why it is so important that you are able to speak with those who do not share our faith. For your own sake, and for the sake of the Holy See, I hope you will speak with the insurgents at the Adders' Nest.", '\nIsse:', "Yes, I'd like to accompany you too, but we've reserved a place for you and Master Gerolt at the back of the procession.\nSpeak with the nunel at the church to reserve your place.

In fact, it would not be prudent for any single nation to commit suicide by itself.\nThe councilors had to be convinced that their cause was righteous, and that a united Eorzea was in our best interests.\nAnd so they met in Ul'dah, where the ambassador awaited.\nIt was there that the matter of the resolution was finally settled─a resolution that, by the grace of the Twelve, will stand.\nYou will recall that the councilors comprised the Alliance's leadership.
