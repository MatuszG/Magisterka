Dialogue: ['\nGullinkambi:', "\nA bargain struck, indeed. I have just now received word that the Children have agreed to release you from your captivity.\nNot a day goes by when I do not wish that our arrangement had been different. You see, I believe─as do many others─that the Blessed are capable of wielding destructive magicks.\nAs a member of the Order of Nald'thal, I have witnessed their use firsthand. As such, I am keenly aware of the potential benefits of working with them.\nYou are, by contrast, a lowly conjurer─a powerless vessel without the necessary training. I am tempted to think you unworthy of the Blessed's attention.\nBut never mind that. What is the matter with you? Are you fit to devote your entire life to the study of destructive magicks?\nVery well. I will assign you your first task as a novice.\nIn the meantime, I suggest you seek out Virdjala, the teacher of the Blessed.\nThere, you will find her at the Conjurers' Guild. I have no doubt that she will be receptive to your request.", '\nVirdjala:', "\nGullinkambi sent you?

As you are a novice, I suppose it would not be prudent to send you out into the world on your own. It would be best, I think, if you attended to your training first.\nThere is, however, one final task I would have you undertake. This time, however, you will do it in my presence.\nThe task is a simple one, but requires an extremely dangerous feat of magick. I would have you summon a powerful entity─an omen of great danger─and then perform a ritual that will hopefully purge its presence from your soul.\nI will explain the ritual once you have learned it. In the meantime, return to the Blessed.", '\nGullinkambi:', '\nYou are returned. I take it you have learned the ritual?\nVery good. The conjurers are always eager to hear of new students.\nThe task I assigned you was meant to test your mental faculties. I had hoped you would be able to perform it without mishap, but I am worried something may have happened had you been less careful.\nThat is not to say it is a waste of time. There is much to be gained from applying the lessons you have learned.\nI see you have not grown complacent. You are still unfit to undertake dangerous magickal endeavors, but it is a necessary evil.\nYou should, however, strive to become more experienced before setting forth on any task.\nI imagine you will have need of my assistance in the future. Until then, I bid you happy studying.']

For example, the “specialization contract,” which covers research and development of new weapons, and the “tradecraft contract,” which covers the promotion of existing weapons.\nEach discipline is worth a certain amount of gil, which is distributed among our various members.\nThe contract also contains a unique authorization number, which is used to track the progress of each contract.\nIf you would like to know more, please speak with our sales representative.

I serve at the pleasure of Lady Laniaitte─a mere ceremonial post, really─but I would be remiss if I neglected my duties here.\nMy name is Janshio, and I am in charge of keeping the bees buzzing here in good health. I also oversee the production of honeybees, as you may have surmised.\nYou may be wondering why I would bother with something so trivial. Well, it has to do with something you see fit to bring to me: a reward. \nThe bees provide us with a bounty of nectar, which we use to build our hives. We also pollinate the flowers that grow around the Wonders─a mutually beneficial arrangement, I should think. \nNot only do the bees and flowers flourish thanks to our cooperation, but we also have a financial incentive to do so. The more flowers we pollinate, the higher our yield, and so on.\nIn exchange for our services, the Adventurers' Guild has established a special reward program. Go and speak with Slafswys in the plaza to receive yours.\nI can see you are still wondering what this reward is all about. It is, as you might expect, something very special. For every delivery, you will receive a sum in honeybees.\nIt is, as you might expect, something very special. For every delivery, you will receive a sum in honeybees.\nOh, but how do I know? I saw you strolling along the way and heard you making a beeline for the bees. So, I shall give you the details, shall I?\nLet me see... The first delivery is for you, and the second for a friend of mine. Both will be delivered in good time.\nI should hope this will suffice. Here is your reward as promised. Now, if you will excuse me, I have some other tasks I would like you to perform."]
