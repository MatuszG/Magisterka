That's not to say you have much to offer, but I do have one more request to make of you.\nIt's a favor I want to ask of you, but it's not something I could ever ask of anyone else.\nA friend of mine has a problem with his wings─he refuses to fly them.

I'll be waiting for you at the scene of the incident!", '\nYugiri:', "\nAh, Forename, I didn't quite get a good look at them.
