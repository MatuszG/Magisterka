The merchant I speak of is an Ul'dahn named Gundobald.\nI have attempted to contact him several times, but have received no response. If you are able to find him, please return to my research and inquire as to his current whereabouts.\nI am quite certain that Gundobald is now deceased, having died in a boating accident some time ago.

I'll get right into the nitty-gritty.\nLet me explain. We've got three bees working for us─a Goldsmith, a Carpenter, and a Tailor.\nThe Goldsmith's the master of our operation. He decides what gets made here, and where. He's a busy man, that one.\nThe Carpenter's the one who repairs our broken stuff, and he's a busy man as well. He's a busy man, that one. And the Tailor...? Well, if ye ask me, that one's a bloody busy man.\nBut where's the fun in making what only makes sense?

We make what we sell, and that's it.\nWhich brings me to the point─why bother making things? If it's not making money, then what use is it?\nFor a start, it makes me money. I get paid for each delivery, which is a handy little perk.\nBut more importantly, it keeps me motivated. If I'm not making money, I'm not doing my job. So why do I do it?\nIt's a fair enough question. There's a lot of reasons, but the key one is money.\nIf I'm to make a living, I've got to make things that people want. Things that they'll pay for. Not something that they can get from somewhere else─not on their own, at least.\nThat's why I went into the business in the first place. I knew there was money to be made, and I wanted to make it.\nBut I also knew that if I was to make it my way, I would have to work long and hard for it─and that's not something anyone wants to hear.\nSo I went into this knowing that I could make it work, and I did. I went into this with the idea that I would make it worth while─not that I expected to make a gil or two.\nI'm still learning, though, and I'd be a fool not to try something new. I had a mind to start small and make a few gil, but I think I need to venture into bigger things first. And you're the first person in my sights.\nIf you take this as a starting point, I'd be ever so grateful if you could spread the word. I'd be a fool not to try something new.

Though the alloy is quite malleable, its crystal structure makes it ideal for use in a bow.\nThe catalyst for this process, however, can only be acquired from a goblin named Uyagir.\nHe is said to reside in the depths of the Agora, in the region known as the Cradle of Darkness.
