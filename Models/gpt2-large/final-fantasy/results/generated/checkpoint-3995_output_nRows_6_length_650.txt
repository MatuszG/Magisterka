They could be lying in wait for someone to come looking...\nStill, our job is not yet finished.

We have a crisis on our hands here, and I fear the honeybee population will not survive if we do not find a solution to the pest problem. If you have a moment, I would like you to assist me in finding one. Three of our hives were infested with the pests when last I returned, and I would be most grateful if you could eliminate the problem in my stead.\nThe problem first arose when we released our new queen bee, Solina, into the woods. The queen is extremely aggressive, and was likely attracted to the pungent scent of our pesticides. She would have made short work of the already stressed out bees.\nWhile Solina is certainly an impressive specimen, I cannot help but think that the pungent scent she attracted was not the only one she was unable to find. The bees may have been poisoned, or the whole colony may have been poisoned.\nWe must act quickly. If we do not, the entire colony may be poisoned!\nI realize we may be forced to reduce the amount of pesticide we use in the short term, but we must put the safety of the bees first.", '\nLonwoerd:', "I would be most grateful if you could eliminate the pests that were bothering our hives.

I'm Tutusi, a cartographer hired by the Adventurers' Guild.\nI have been tasked with making a map of Ul'dah's borders, and if you might humor me, I believe I can help with the task.\nThe problem I face is that although the Sunsilk Tapestries has long been the go-to shop for travelers, I cannot very well tell them apart─not without help.\nIf I were to ask everyone in Ul'dah what they call the capital, would you not expect a few of them to give different names? I've tried asking around, but everyone─even some of the most famous─seems to have some sort of problem.\nI would be grateful if you could help in identifying the locations of our two cities.

The Coliseum, of course, is marked in yellow.\nThe Serpent's Tongue is to the west, and the Bazaar is to the east. The Rising Stones is in the center, as you would expect.\nOh, and the Coliseum is not included, I believe. Ah, well. Here you go.\nNow, what I would not give to be able to travel freely between these two cities, but alas, I must abide by the guildmaster's order.\nI must say, it has been quite an experience. I can see now why so many choose to live here─it is a great city with a rich history. It just might be that my map lies somewhere within your realm...\nWell, I must be off. I apologize for asking such a trifling task of you, but I hope the experience has been worth it. Take this in exchange for your help."]
