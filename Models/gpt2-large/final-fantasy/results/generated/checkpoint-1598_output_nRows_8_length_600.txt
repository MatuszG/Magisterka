Dialogue: ['\nLyingmog:', "\nNow that's what I call a “breath of fresh air.” It's all thanks to you! Now I can finally return to doing my job.\nIt was the Mists, you see, that gave birth to the creatures known as the “mogzons,” which were originally created to clean up after the Flood. They were, and still are, quite useful, but they were all too eager to kill any mongrels they came across.\nLuckily, one such creature managed to slip in through the cracks, and I managed to track it down. It was trying to eat some of the mongrels, but I managed to stop it before it could get any further.\nNow, I'm not sure what kind of creature it was, but I'm pretty sure it wasn't a mongrel. It was probably a member of some other species of beast, but I can't very well ask you to slay it. It's my duty to keep the Mists clean─that's why I wanted you here to do it, after all.\nYou should've seen how scared it was when it tried to eat the mongrels! I managed to get it to stop trying by giving it a poke─it looked like a cross between a mongoose and a kobold, and I couldn't get it to move.\nOh, I should mention that you'll be hearing a lot more of my stories from me in the future. I've already got some great new ones for you to hear!", '\nLyingmog:', "\nI'm sure you've heard some of the stories, but I'll bet you didn't see one like this!
