Dialogue: ['\nGildon:', '\nI trust you have heard of the beekeeper's prayer? It is, of course, a simple but effective way of ensuring that your crop is ready to harvest when it is.\nIt is no small task to keep the bees buzzing and buzzing, but if you could do so while also protecting them from harm, it would be a tremendous boon to both the local environment and to the local economy.\nAs such, I have been asked to share with you the details of how I have been asked to perform my duties.\nMy instructions are as follows: you must deliver this message to any bees you find in the vicinity of the hive. Do not forget to check the location of the hive before you begin your search.\nOnce you have dispatched the bees, collect your reward─it is yours to take, as well as the bees'.', '\nGildon:', '\nYou have dispatched the bees? I am relieved to see that you were able to get the job done.\nIt seems you are not one to let their guard down, which is good news for both you and the local environment.\nIt has been my experience that the bees will fly to any place they perceive an opening. If you were to give them a signal to come, I am sure they would make their way here in no time at all.']

You'll have to seek them out in the village of Amh Araeng, which overlooks the site of the last battle.\nIn case you're unfamiliar with the island, it's one of the last strongholds of the Amh Alai tribe, and was once the home of the first king of Ala Ghiri.\nSince the Calamity changed the surrounding environment, however, there are fewer trees and fewer plants, meaning it's difficult to grow crops. And the island is filled with beasts that could tear you limb from limb.\nFortunately, Caitlyn has a plan to overcome these hardships─one that takes the use of a blessed instrument.\nI'm certain you'll find it a useful ally in your battle against the beasts. Please, take this as a token of my gratitude.", '\nCaitlyn:', "\nThank you for your help, Forename.

That would be an intriguing development...\nI can't imagine what manner of magic you wields, but I can certainly imagine that a great number of your fellow Eorzeans possess it.\nI imagine you are curious as to how it works.\nBut I imagine that is well and good. As for me, I shall try and answer any questions you may have.\nBut first, let me present you with your instrument of choice.\nI wish to know, did you know of the “Blessing of the Sultana”?\nIn ancient times, the sultana was goddess of beauty and refinement. She was believed to possess an affinity with music that transcended all boundaries.\nShe was also believed to be the only one who could grant freedom to her subjects through music.\nTo this day, her name is sometimes used to refer to any female deity.\nAnd yet, she is not the only one who is referred to in this manner.

It was obvious that you were not improving in your craft.\nBut perhaps the difference is in your discipline.\nI am confident that you will become a far better smith once you understand the concepts behind the techniques you employ.\nIn any case, I am pleased to inform you that your metallurgy has progressed to a satisfactory degree!\nNow, I must admit, I am rather disappointed.

Dialogue: ['\nSerendipity:', "\nWell met, adventurer. Have you ever seen such beauty?\nA lovely young girl─a girl who looks quite pretty herself. I don't know why you didn't think to ask her out on a date...\nPerhaps you're confused. She's a visitor from another world─a place I know not what to do with.\nI suppose it would be best if you could explain to her what it means to be here in Limsa Lominsa.\nShe's quite friendly, and I'll go ahead and introduce her to you.\nOh, and do be sure to introduce your own guildmaster to her as well. I'll wait here.", '\nSerendipity:', "\nWelcome back! I take it she's not here to hear about your adventures?\nOh, I see. Well, if she's not here to hear about your adventures, then it's best she doesn't know about yours.\nI understand that she's taken some time off from her studies to visit you─it's a big decision to make─but I hope she'll come back to us eventually. She's been so kind to you."]

When the mode is engaged, the airship will fly in a straight line, like a glider.\nOf course, you'll want to practice flying the airship before you take it to battle. I've prepared a new game for you, which I hope you'll enjoy.\nTake the airship and fly it in the direction of the Empire's main base.
