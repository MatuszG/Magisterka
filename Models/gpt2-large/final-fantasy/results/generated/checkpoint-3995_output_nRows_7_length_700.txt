I mean, wouldn't it be far more impressive if each member of the team were to contribute a singularly original idea?\n...Ahem. I believe I have made my point.\nIf you would excuse me, I have a rather interesting report to share with you. It concerns the proposed expansion of the Eulmoran Empire's borders.\nMultiple borderland fortifications were proposed as part of the expansion, but each proposal was met with some amount of resistance.\nOne would assume that the Empire would not willingly open its gates to a barbarian tribe if that tribe were to threaten its existence. But is this not the reason why the Ala Mhigan refugees sought refuge in our nation?\nThey believed that if the Empire were to open its gates, it would be to their benefit. And so they did.\nBut why did the Empire elect to construct its own fortifications instead of joining the rest of Eorzea in taking up arms against the Ixal?\nOne can only assume that the answer to that question is, “Because it is necessary.”\nIndeed, the Empire's construction of its own fortifications is indicative of a larger shift in power that has taken place in recent memory.\nIf one is to believe the refugees' account of the matter, the Ixal are no longer a force to be reckoned with. Nay, they are an enemy to be eradicated.\nAnd yet, the Ala Mhigan refugees believe that a single genius conceived of the idea, and that he would make a suitable partner for the Scions in their fight against the Ixal.\nIf one is to believe the Ala Mhigan refugees' account of the matter, the Ixal are no longer a force to be reckoned with. Nay, they are an enemy to be eradicated.", '\nEstinien:', "I had no doubts that the Scions would triumph, Forename, but 'twas a sight more like the Warriors of Light than I had dared hope.\nIt is but a matter of time before the Ixal are exterminated, and yet this I cannot bring myself to believe.\nWhy should I? 'tis not as though I have anything against the Ixal─far from it.\nBut there may be a way to prevent the Ixal from taking our beloved Ala Mhigan. I know not what it is, but one thing is certain─we must do all in our power to stop them."]

'Tis an honor to meet another of Limsa Lominsa's famed blacksmiths.\nYour assistance with the restoration of Falcon's Nest was a most welcome development.\nWith the aid of famed blacksmith Eginolf, we have crafted a fine ashield for the ceremonial instrument of House Haillenarte, one of the most noble of the orders.\nIt is an honor to see our efforts come to fruition. Though I admit there was a slight delay in fulfilling your request for the part.\nEginolf has been hard at work at the forge ever since the High Houses began distributing allotments of metal to their soldiers.\nThe task was made easier by the fact that Falcon's Nest was already well-to-do when the occupation began, thanks to the manufactory's contribution to the Allied victory at the Battle of Carteneau.\nIt is not uncommon for houses to send tribute from their own coffers to support the confraternity. This practice began after the fall of Castrum Oriens and continued during the Ishgardian occupation.\nFalcon's Nest was established as a place of worship following the Battle of Carteneau, and it is from there that many of our ancestors honored the memory of our fallen.\nWhen Lord Francel asked that we use your precious ashield in his cathedral, it was no small honor that he chose you to play the role of confraternity member. It is only fitting that you join him in the future, Forename.\nI am certain that Falcon's Nest will befit your talents should you continue to serve us in the future.\nWhen next you visit our smith, may you be assured that his creations will last a lifetime."]

Title: A Brave Resolution
Dialogue: ['\nHien:', "\nI bid you welcome to the Convictory. My name is Hien, and I am a Lieutenant of the Sultansworn elite.\nYou are come at a most opportune time, my friend. The Order of the Twin Adder has need of an able ambassador, and I can think of none more suited to the task.\nI would be most honored if you could deliver a report to Mistress Momodi of the Convictory. Her duties demand that she be present at the Rising Stones whenever our esteemed guests are invited, and I understand that attending to them requires all the strength I can muster.", '\nMomodi:', '\nAh, Hien of the Sultansworn. I take it you have been dispatched from Limsa Lominsa to meet with the Holy See.\nI have been expecting you, Forename, and I am more than a little pleased to see that you have made the acquaintance of one of our most capable and capable envoys.\nWhen you last left, you spoke of a resolution which, if passed, would see Gridania liberated from the Empire.\nJudging by the envoys you have met and the promises you have made, I have every confidence that the time has come for the people of Ul'dah to make the necessary preparations.\nOnce the necessary preparations are complete, I can only imagine the havoc which can be wrought if the Garleans are allowed to return to their homes.\nAye, the Holy See has no doubt been keeping a close eye on the situation in the region. Should the Empire wish to make good on their threats, they will need no matter what the cost.\nI should hope that the leaders of Ul'dah will not be put off by the idea of bringing the Holy See into the midst of our struggles.\nIndeed, I do not believe that a single imperial soldier will be sufficient to contend with the task. Count on us, my friends, to bring the fight to the Empire's doorstep.']

Dialogue: ['\nResistance Councilor:', "We all know the cost of war. But to pluck the courage to stand against the Empire on its own is a truly heroic endeavor.\nAnd I can tell you, Forename, that the people of Eorzea are no less eager to see this resolution come to fruition.\nBut let us not dwell on the present. When next we meet, I trust you will remember my esteemed comrade, Commander Falkbryda, for his role in facilitating this resolution.\nAnd when you speak with her, I am certain she will share with you her knowledge of the resistance's most desperate hour.", '\nFalkbryda:', "Well met, Commander. 'Tis good to see you.\nResistance Councilor Jebei is already hard at work attempting to translate the resolution into local Arrzaneth. I am certain she will be happy to assist you in your efforts.\nI imagine the Resistance will need all the help it can get in the coming days. But if you can spare a moment, I would ask you to call on me at the Ruby Price.\nThere you will find the Ruby Price, where the council of the Resistance takes place. I would be most grateful if you could pay your respects.", '\nFalkbryda:', "I am most grateful for your presence, Commander. I will make sure the people of Eorzea are not left behind.\nThe Resistance will not be defeated so easily. But we may yet be saved by the hero who answered our call.\nIf you could pay your respects to Commander Falkbryda at the Ruby Price, I would be most grateful.", '\nCommander Falkbryda:', 'I am most grateful for your presence, Commander. I will make sure the people of Eorzea are not left behind.\nIf you can spare a moment, I would ask you to call on me at the Ruby Price.\nThere you will find the Ruby Price, where the council of the Resistance takes place. I would be most grateful if you could pay your respects.', '\nFalkbryda:', "I am most grateful for your presence, Commander. I will make sure the people of Eorzea are not left behind.\nAnd while I would not blame you for casting a shadow that dark, it would not have been possible without the help of the Scions.\nOur victory may not count for much in the grand scheme of things, but it is a start. And we can all learn a thing or two from the experience.\nSo please, keep telling Commander Falkbryda of your efforts. I will make sure the Resistance knows you are not to be underestimated."]

I never even heard his voice on the other end of the conversation...\nI suppose it's only a matter of time before they find him, too. I hope we can count on you, Commander Kemp!"]
