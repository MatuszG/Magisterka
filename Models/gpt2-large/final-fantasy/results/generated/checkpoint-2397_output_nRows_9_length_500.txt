Dialogue: ['\nMinfilia:', '\nI am pleased to report that the Enterprise has arrived safely at the gates of Nym─a settlement which, according to our scouts, was recently liberated from the Empire.', '\nAlphinaud:', '\nAnd thus our heroes set forth once more, to free the people of their homeland.\n...What, you didn't think the Empire would simply lay down their arms and surrender?\nWell, we were wrong. After analyzing the recently discovered ruins, the Ixal came to the conclusion that the ruins contained ancient magitek weaponry.\nIt was decided that the only way to stop the Empire was to disable their weapon systems. Thus was born the Resistance, and the founding of our nation.\nI suppose I can safely say that this is the first time the Empire has ever been defeated on the battlefield.\nBut I fear that our victory is not to be celebrated. The fact remains that the Empire continues to maintain a presence in the region, and that its soldiers still hold key positions.\nI fear that if we do not take every available resource into account, we will be left with little more than a symbolic victory.\nNevertheless, we have at least made a start. The people of Nym are eager to see the Resistance rebuild its military, and I for one would welcome the chance to work with them again.']

The only person with access to these records is the recently deceased Mother of the Destroyer, who was found in the ruins after the Calamity.\nConsidering the extremely dangerous nature of the place, it would be a miracle if anyone were to find them. Even the strongest of warriors─such as those found in the ruins─would be unable to survive in them for long.\nIn order to find these records, we must first gain the trust of the local tribes.

Title: A Brief Reprieve
Dialogue: ['\nAdalberta:', "\nThe imperials' latest assault has left us with no choice but to take drastic measures.\nConsequently, the Order of the Twin Adder has been charged with organizing relief efforts.\nTo that end, the Order has set aside a sufficient number of man-made islands to provide suitable respite. These islands, known as bastions, are situated in the vicinity of the eastern entrenchment.\nAccording to our records, there have been no reports of hostile activity within the past week. This suggests that the imperials have yet to establish a foothold on the bastions.\nIt would appear that the Empire's advance has been slowed only by their own supply lines. If the imperials are to make a lasting dent in the Resistance's ranks, they must first reduce the number of their encampments."]

Dialogue: ['\nBertliana:', "\n<sigh> I'm afraid I've nothing further to add on the matter of your...attendance.\nIn any case, I'm pleased to report that my colleagues and I have managed to finish deciphering the tablet's secrets. We can now safely assume that the magi's final wish is to commune with the Source─and that the Time Lord has finally agreed to do the deed.\nAt long last, the final wish has been granted! The Final Days will finally be a time for the Light to shine upon the world once more.\nThe tablet itself contains a crystal which, when broken, will unleash a devastating wave of lightning. The exact mechanism of the effect is yet to be determined, but it is believed to be the work of the aetherial energy stored within the crystal's recesses.\nAs before, we shall need you to break the crystal in our stead. I trust you to do this without delay.\nOnce you have succeeded in doing so, please deliver the crystal to the Elezen scholar who has custody of it─R'ashaht Rhiki. She will be most pleased to receive it, and we can all breathe a sigh of relief that the Final Days will finally be a time for the Light to shine upon the world once more.", '\nR'ashaht Rhiki:', "\nOh, hello there. How might I be of service?\nAh, yes, of course, of course! I had been expecting you by my countenance.\n...But not to discuss your attendance. You see, my colleague here has been keeping a close watch on the crystal's whereabouts, and she has been keeping a close watch on you, as well.\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I have more pressing matters to attend to.", '\nBertliana:', "\nR'ashaht Rhiki will be pleased to receive the crystal. You have my sincerest gratitude.", '\nBertliana:', "\nThe crystal arrived safely, and thanks to you, we can finally resume the Final Days' festivities!\nBut enough about me and my...what's a guildmaster to do? If you would like to know more, I suggest you speak with my colleague here first. She can fill you in
