They put on a brave face, but their hearts are of steel.\nI have no doubt that they will do all in their power to defend our nation. But to face the Warrior of Light himself, I cannot help but fear...\nPerhaps I am too worried. After all, he has so much wealth at his disposal. Surely he can look past the desires of a few to benefit the many.\nI am, of course, also relieved.

Each piece is crafted with love and respect, and I hope you'll be pleased to own a piece of it.\nThe first of these gifts is a banjo. You'll find it just behind the left ear. It's a simple but effective instrument, and one that I've deemed worthy of a Talos player's collection.\nThe next gift is an udgiri. It's the horn of a gedan. I've chosen this particular species because of its beauty. The wood is resilient yet warm, and when struck it produces a lovely, sparkling sound.\nLastly, I present you with an opo–opo. This is the shell of an orchid. The petals are especially sensitive, and so I've carved a special hole in the middle for your preferred lute.\nNow all you need to do is pick up your instrument, and take it to the udgiri in front of you.

They were used to craft holy instruments, and it was from this that the Talos was born.\nI suppose it only makes sense that the landlords would want to preserve the history of their homes, and so they placed these stones in places of worship.\nNaturally, the Talos was born from this desire, and the same stone is used to craft the gedan's shell and horn.\nNow, while these are fine gifts, I wouldn't ask you to play the same piece over and over. I'd like you to try and develop your taste for each piece, and I hope this will help you do just that.\nOf course, as I said before, I would ask you to play the same piece over and over. That's why I've prepared this little challenge for you. The first person to find the perfect combination of sounds wins!\nSo, what do you think?

Dialogue: ['\nAuphiliot:', "\nI've got a mission for you, if you're interested in going it alone. It won't take long, I promise.\nI'll meet you on the Hustings Strip, over in the North Shroud.\nI need you to head up to the mountain and gather three bottles of an aetherial fluid.\nYou can use this to mix it with the resin you brought here, and the result is a substance called avarice syrup. It's a potent medicine, and if you use it long enough, your body will adapt.\nI don't need you to stick around and mix it. After a few applications, you'll be ready to go.\nWhen you're ready, meet me back here. I'll be waiting for you.", '\nAuphiliot:', "\nYou're back! Did you bring the avarice syrup?\nPerfect! This is just what we needed to get the synthesis started. Avarice is a valuable resource in our world, and we can't have people dying from preventable causes.\nIt's worth it to have that kind of a decision to backfire...\nBut I'm sure you'd rather have me stay and see the results. I don't think anyone's seen a result quite like this one yet!\nIf you want to try your hand at synthesis again, I suggest you seek out Syneyhil over in the North Shroud. He has experience working with similar concoctions and can answer any questions you might have.", '\nSyneyhil:', "\nWelcome back. You are now free to choose between synthesis and avarice. I trust you enjoyed the experience?\nAye─you certainly did! Avarice syrup is one of the main ingredients in many of the recipes my customers love. It is, however, one of the most difficult to produce.\nYou'll find it a daunting task to begin with, but with a little help from our friends down below, you too can have the chance to make it yourself.\nI would be most grateful if you'd take the time to speak with one of our fellow Synthesisers. They can guide you through the process, and even provide you with a few sample recipes to try!"]

Dialogue: ['\nTaina:', "I've been thinking, Forename. In order to secure the Echo, we first need to defeat Garuda, the Lady of the Vortex.\nBut I fear that I am not strong enough to do it alone.\nI would be much obliged if you could assist me. The primal is to be found in her domain─the Coliseum.\nYou should be able to find her by following the road north from Ul'dah's Sunsilk Tapestries.\nOnce you've defeated the Lady of the Vortex, you will be granted an audience with Taina. Pray go on ahead and face the primal.", '\nTaina:', "Welcome back, Forename.\nAfter your victory in the Coliseum, it is clear that you are capable of handling yourself against a primal.\nBut before we can plan our next move, we must consult with our allies in the Maelstrom.\nThey are certain to differ with regards to where the next battle will be fought.\nI would have you travel to Camp Tranquil and seek out Commander Swift. He will be glad to oblige you.", '\nSwift:', "The Maelstrom is not wont to beseech assistance from foreign armies.\nNevertheless, I am glad to see you in Limsa Lominsa. The Admiral will be pleased to hear of your success.\nIndeed, she was. Shortly before you arrived, Lady Laniaitte informed me of the Echo's location. She would have us enter the fray right away.\nI have been thinking about our next move. While I am still disappointed with our defeat, we must at least put the matter to rest.\nI have prepared a letter to be delivered to Lady Laniaitte. Please be sure to deliver it to her.", '\nLady Laniaitte:', "A letter? From Taina, you say. Let me see...\nOh, this is from her? I'm not sure I follow. But then...it must be from you! In her stead, I offer you my heartfelt thanks.\nThe Maelstrom would not be the same without you, Forename. And you have proven yourself capable of holding your own against the Lady of the Vortex.

Forename, I am glad to see you again─and not just for the sake of my own reputation.\nAs you may have heard, I am in a difficult position as it pertains to my role as leader of the Sultansworn. Our order's reputation has taken a hit, and it is my hope that our new recruits will rise to the challenge.\nYou are familiar with the notion of “boldness,” do you not agree? I would be most grateful if you could add your name to the list of Sultansworn who have made historic decisions in the past.\nIn fact, I would be most honored if you could add your name to the list of Sultansworn who have made historic decisions this day.\nIt has been an honor and a privilege, Forename, to lead you through many and more difficult times. I have no doubt that your efforts will be the greatest source of inspiration for the new recruits as they embark on their path to becoming true Sultansworn.\nI would be most honored if you could add your name to the list of Sultansworn who have made historic decisions this day.\nI should not be surprised if you are the one who has made the boldest decision of all time. The list could not be further divided.\nThe first of our order's founders to rise to such heights was Haldrath, who in 853 B.C.E. led his people from the Steppe into the heart of Dravania.\nThe second was Ansert, who in 953 B.C.E. led his people from the desert into the heart of Ala Mhigo.\nThe third was Gyr Abania, who in 953 B.C.E. led his people from the Steppe into the heart of Hyrstmill.\nAnd the last was Uin Hagan, who in 953 B.C.E. led his people from the Steppe into the heart of Ul'dah.\nHaldrath, Ansert, Gyr Abania, and Uin Hagan are all considered to be the first three Sultansworn who have made the most important decisions. It is my hope that the new recruits will choose to honor the legacy of these great leaders by taking up their roles and fulfilling their duties.\nIn order to attract new blood to our brotherhood, it is important that we prove to them that there is more to the Sultansworn than their swords and shields.\nAnd by taking up their roles, they will have the opportunity to grow as a Sultansworn and take their place alongside the first three.\nSo it is that I turn to you once more─to ask for your assistance in taking the first step along the path to becoming a true Sultansworn.\nIt is a daunting task, but if you are up to the task, I have no doubt that you will be rewarded for your efforts.\nPlease, take this as recompense for your assistance. It is but a small token of what you have done for me and the Sultansworn."]

That's when I decided to pursue a life of leisure, spending my days poring over the books at the Holy See.\nWhen I was returned last, I found myself beset with a host of new problems. One of them was a book that required a solution, and so I asked a friend of mine, a retired professor, to prepare a report on the matter. I gave him charge of writing the final page.\nI can't say he was able to finish the job, though.\nWhat's more, he went so far as to disguise his own writing as that of another─a clear attempt to deceive his employer!\nNow I've tracked down the professor, and he insists that he can't be found.

I was just about to deliver a message to a friend, and I've got to say, it's about time you made your way here. There's been quite a flurry of activity in the kitchens of late, and I've been running out of fresh ingredients to cook with.\nLuckily, I know someone who can make an abundance of fresh, nutritious meals from scratch.

But of course─fresh vegetables don't grow in our village!\nIf Nu Mou wanted vegetables, she would have gone to Pla Enni or another nearby village.

But even if she had to make the choice between the two, she would be making a terrible mistake.\nRadish soup is packed with a lot of nutrients, but it's packed with so much salt that even a small amount of it can overwhelm the body. If only there were some other vegetable soup that was packed with nutrients but wasn't so salty...\nOh, you want fresh vegetables. That's fine by me, I'm certainly not opposed to eating my vegetables raw. But I'm asking you to go and speak with someone else, and I'm not asking you to go to Pla Enni or some other faraway place!", '\nOggery:', "I'm sure you've had your share of grueling decisions in your life, and I'm sure you can relate to the burden that a chef like mine has to bear.
