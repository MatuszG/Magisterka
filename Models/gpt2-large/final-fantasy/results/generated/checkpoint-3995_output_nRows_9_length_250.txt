Title: A Brief Reprieve
Dialogue: ['\nLaniaitte:', "Ah, Forename. I trust you are enjoying your atma–infused relic?\nBy what miracle it still worked, I wonder... I mean, how could it not?\nSpeaking of which, there was a report just now from my associates in Limsa Lominsa. They have managed to retrieve some of the atma–infused materia, you see.\nThough I am not sure what they hope to accomplish with such a trifling find...\nThough I am sure they will be quick to point out that retrieving materia is only one part of the atma–infused relic's restoration process.\nIn fact, one associate even went so far as to say that they want the materia to be on display at the “Reclamation” event, to be held in Ul'dah in the near future.\nI am tempted to go myself, but I fear I would be too easily overwhelmed by the enormity of the task. Forgive me, Forename. Might I trouble you to attend the event in my stead? I will be along shortly.\nA

Dialogue: ['\nWanderingbreeze:', "\nI tell you, this place sure is a mite too quiet for a Lady of the Vortex.\nI'm sure you're wondering where I could have possibly found myself. Well, it's none of your business, I assure you!\nI simply happened to look in on a couple having a child together, and saw the little one cry. Curious, I went to check what could have caused such a fuss, only to find that the little one was no longer with its mother.\nI'm not entirely certain, but I think it might have been related to one of the monsters that infest the area. A stray or two from the chaos, you know.\nI can't be certain, but I've a hunch the baby was with its mother when it was attacked, so it can't have escaped. I'll stay here and look for it, just in case. Please, will you help me look for it?\nI can't very well leave the baby there unattended for too long. I'll stay here and see what has become of it.", '\nWanderingbree

Dialogue: ['\nCibleroit:', '\nYou there! A moment. I have a favor to ask of you.\nI was just leaving to drop some provisions off at one of the outposts when a band of Sahagin caught my eye. They looked to be in the middle of a fight. I dispatched them and made off with my load.\nWhat made them fight? Why did they fight? What were they thinking? No one knows for sure. But we can make some educated guesses.\nBased on their garish armor and primitive weapons, I have a good idea of what type of warriors they are.
