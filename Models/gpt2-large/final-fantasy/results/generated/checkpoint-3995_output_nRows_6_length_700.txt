Dialogue: ['\nBoy03546:', "Can I help you, mister? It's my turn to ask, but I've got something that I really, really need.\nYou see, I was looking around an abandoned house and I found a map of Amh Araeng, with a big, big cross drawn on it. It was right there in my hand, you see.\nI want to find my family, you see, and I want to be reunited with them...but I can't do it myself.\nIf I ask anyone in the village, they'll laugh in my face and call me a coward. But if I ask Father Gundobald at the church, he'll be so nice, he'll let me go and find my family.", '\nBoy03546:', "Can you draw a map for me? I'll pay you for this.\nOh, thank you! Here, this is the spot where I was looking. Line up the cross with the houses, and it should lead you right to the heart of the settlement.\nI was so nervous, I nearly dropped the map!\nI'm really, really glad you found me! I'll tell you one last time─don't take too long with these. Just make sure you find my family, and tell them I'm okay!", '\nBoy03546:', "They'll laugh in my face, but I really, really need this. Please, mister, I really, really need this!", '\nBoy03546:', "Right, I'm ready!
