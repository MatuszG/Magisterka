I was only supposed to buy a book, but I've ended up with more books than I can count.\nI'm at my wit's end, and I fear I won't make it through this month if I don't find a way to sift through the stacks.

He was once a member of the Allagan Empire's elite, but he defected to the Resistance after realizing the extent of the corruption within.\nHe was put on death's door after defecting, but he's set his sights on Ul'dah. He wants to see the city for himself, and has even taken to calling it his home.\nHe's been kind to me this month, offering to take me on a shopping spree if I promise to buy anything at the very least. I'm not sure what the deal is, but I'm sure he's not going to ask me about my past─would you be willing to help me look for something?\nIf I find something, I'm sure Gerolt will be excited to know it. He always is.\nWould you be willing to search for something for me? It might be at the very least a book about the city of Ul'dah. I can't very well end my own life now.

Dialogue: ['\nFalkbryda:', "Good morrow, sir. I trust you have done your part to bring peace to the markets.       \nI am pleased to say that not only are the stalls still standing, but so too are the goods! If you have a moment, I would ask you to take these trinkets to the Gorgagne Mills.\nThe markets were not always thus. The Calamity stripped away much of the merchant life that was once so vibrant, and what little remained was distributed among the poor to make ends meet.\nIt was these very merchants who helped bring about the end of the Ala Mhigan Era, and we feel indebted to them. We would be fools not to take what little we can get.\nNow, what I would ask of you is a little more difficult to explain─I want you to take these trinkets to Gorgagne Mills, where they will be displayed for all to see.\nThere, you have it. Take them to Gorgagne Mills and show them to all. I am sure that─ Oh, I do hope you do not encounter any resistance... At any rate, you have our thanks for bringing these trinkets to us.\nThe Ala Mhigan Resistance fighters often made use of these trinkets to make their own makeshift weapons. Though they did not have the same degree of quality as our own Garlean counterparts, they were nevertheless useful.\nI am pleased to say that we have been able to restock our stock of weapons in recent days.\nI do not know what you might face in the future, but I hope that you might still seek out these old friends when next you go to the markets."]

It might even be enough to convince some of the locals that there's more to these parts than just Garlean activity.\nThe Garleans may be gone, but their presence here is still plain to see.\nIf you see any Garleans, leave them be. I can't very well send supplies to a camp that's been overrun with them.\nAnd if you happen to come across any imperials, kill or drive them away.\nThat's about it.

I do not believe I could have chosen a better weapon.\nI will need the blade steel and the hilt steel.

I trust you have found the weapon I requested?\nBy the gods! I have not seen such fine work before!\nIt is of little wonder that the baron has such a lust for fine weapons. He spends a great deal of time talking about his favorite subjects.\nI do not doubt that he sees a connection between arms and soul, but to have so much influence over others... It gives me pause to imagine the amount of power he must have if he is truly the archbishop.\nRegardless, I am honored to have been able to work with you. I shall make the necessary arrangements to have the weapon delivered to the intended recipient.\nIn the meantime, I shall be requesting another set of materials from the smith.\nThis time, you will not be working with the drunken Toad, but rather the weaponsmith who works at the Drunken Toad.\nPlease, take this steel to him so that he may see the finished product. Oh, and if you do not mind my asking, do not tell him that I will be needing further payment for my services.", '\nSorashs Koal:', '\nMy thanks to you─I am very much looking forward to seeing the weapon I have been seeking!\nIt is a great honor to have been able to work with someone so respected.

My name is Granson, and I am responsible for the creation of this very facility.\nWhen I first laid eyes on this place, I had a feeling that it would be a place of quiet sanctuary for the Humes─a place where we might reflect on our troubles and heal, if you will.\nOf course, now that I have begun to think about it, the thought of all those restless souls screaming in the dark is somewhat disconcerting. Might I trouble you to check on the welfare of the inhabitants?\nI can think of no one more suited to the task.

Dialogue: ['\nZlatan:', "\nAccording to Master Gerolt, the means by which emotional energies are committed to the Resistance weapons is perhaps the most crucial part of the refinement process.\nSomehow, the House of Splendors has contrived an incantation they believe will do precisely that, inspired by the techniques used to create materia. They are penned to magicked scrolls, no doubt designed to expire after a handful of uses. But I digress...\nIn exchange for these scrolls, they have asked we procure crystallized memories of the dying. Our work on the Resistance weapons has garnered their attention, it seems, and now they wish to study the crystals to perhaps refine their own wares.\nI would rather we didn't have to share the techniques of our forebears, but if this is the price we must pay to benefit Bozja's future, so be it.\nI will forgo explanations on how to acquire them, as you are already quite familiar. You need only know they have requested two varieties of memories, thirty of each.", "\nZlatan:", "\nWelcome back, Blade Surname. Regana's colleague arrived with the magicked scrolls earlier. As she was doubtless eager to see how the Resistance weapons would perform, I was not surprised to see her take command of the site.\nAnd yet, as I suspected, the requests made of these scrolls are rather extensive. Quite how the House of Splendors plans to commercialize this research is not yet clear.\nI will not pretend I have all the answers, but I do think it prudent to learn what they have learned when next we meet."]
