Dialogue: ['\nSeverian:', '\nI, Severian, have been entrusted with the execution of some of the most important and difficult tasks to come before us.\nOne of those tasks concerns the preparation of a new instrument, the Sultansworn.\nWhile it would not be my intention to deceive you, the truth is that I am in fact the owner of the instrument. I have had a chance to practice my craft on several occasions, but it would seem that the skill with which I have been able to perform is not quite the same as it was when I first laid eyes on it.\nWith this in mind, I have asked the esteemed Master of the Sultansworn, Ul'dahnssa, to attend to the task.\nI am certain that she will do so with the utmost haste. If you would agree to assist me, pray speak with Ul'dahnssa at the Sultansworn Guild.', '\nUl'dahnssa:', '\nAye, I'm Ul'dahnssa. Severian sent you?\nThat was you? I was expecting a new recruit.\nAh, a novice, yes. The name is Severian.\nAh, but Severian is not a novice. He is a veteran, and his abilities far surpass even those of the most accomplished craftsmen of our age.\nThe Sultansworn is the culmination of his years of training.\nIt is a masterpiece of perfection, and I can think of no one more capable of it.\nIt is my hope that you will use it to great effect─to protect your friends, and to do your part to preserve the peace.', '\nUl'dahnssa:', "\nWell, it's settled then. I shall take the opportunity to see the Sultansworn in action.\nI shall be at the guild until the day I die. If you would agree to assist me, pray speak with Ul'dahnssa at the Sultansworn Guild.", '\nUl'dahnssa:', '\nPray speak with Ul'dahnssa at the Sultansworn Guild.', '\nUl'dahnssa:', '\nPray speak with Ul'dahnssa at the Sultansworn Guild.', '\nUl'dahnssa:', "\nPray speak with Ul'dahnssa at the Sultansworn Guild.', '\nUl'dahnssa:', '\nPray speak with Ul'dahnssa at the Sultansworn Guild.', '\nUl'dahnssa:', '\nPray speak with Ul'dahnssa at the Sultansworn Guild.', '\nUl'dahnssa:', '\nPray speak with Ul'dahnssa at the Sultansworn Guild.', '\nUl'dahnssa:', '\nPray speak with Ul'dahnssa at the Sultans
