I see you have not yet forgotten how you helped us to reclaim the Domans' remains.\nI have been in contact with an acquaintance of mine, and she is in possession of a rather unusual item.\nIt is a gift─a custom of the Domans to decorate their manors with carved ornaments. I am told this particular piece was carved from a mammoth tusk, and depicts the primal Titan itself.\nI am told it was carved with the intent of protecting its owner from the beast's piteous, tear-inducing eyes─an eye which would have rendered the beast utterly unstoppable.\nMy contact was not surprised that the Domans would choose this particular piece, and I suspect she was even more surprised when I informed her of the circumstances surrounding its discovery.\nIt is a shame, but it is a testament to the skill of our forebears that they were able to acquire such a valuable gift.\nI am told the tusk was last sighted in the region surrounding the ruins of Pharos Sirius.

I could not have asked for a better welcome!\nYou see, the udgan of the Steppe were blessed by the gods to receive a gift from the Carpenters' Guild.\nWe call it the “Hearer's Anthem,” and it is sung in the homes of the Ul'dah elite─the udgan that are blessed with the most excellent instruments.\nThat is why, as our nation's patron, I would see it honored in song.\nThat is why I am pleased to offer you this gift─a piece of Ul'dah folklore woven from the most fantastic instruments─as a token of my gratitude.\nNow, as you can see, this gift is a work of art unto itself. However, its very existence speaks to an equally fascinating tale within our nation.\nLegend tells that, when the gods deem a man worthy of the udgan's patronage, they grant him the power to summon forth a legendary instrument.\nSuch instruments are said to possess the power to grant untold benefits to their wielders.\nIn the case of this gift, we would speak of a talisman that is said to have once belonged to the beloved wife of an Ul'dahn nobleman.\nAlas, the talisman was stolen by the villainous Amalj'aa during a failed robbery attempt. Unable to reclaim it, the husband turned to his beloved wife's instrument and begged her to perform the Hearer's Anthem for him.\nIt is said that the tale of the thief's wife and her legendary instrument began with a beggar who happened to pass by when he was handing out food. As he did so, a brilliant light flashed in his eyes and he cried out in a powerful melody. When the beggar recognized the melody, he promptly ran home, saying that he had seen the legendary instrument in his own eyes.\nThe tale of the instrument's theft, however, is not entirely one-sided. In fact, the tale of its owner is one of many that are told in the homes of the Ul'dah elite.\nFor this reason, I would like to offer you a piece of folklore woven from the most fantastic instruments as a token of my gratitude.\nPlease allow me to tell you more about this gift in greater detail once you have received it.\nIn the tale of the thief's wife and her legendary instrument, a beggar was handing out food when a brilliant light flashed in his eyes.

From that moment on, he knew that something wonderful had happened.\nAnd, as our nation's patron, I am pleased to offer you a piece of folklore woven from the most fantastic instruments as a token of my gratitude.

Please hurry, for the elementals are likely to be in a frenzy at any moment now...", '\nIliud:', "Ah, you are returned. Have you brought the grains of the wood?\nAh, yes, these are fine, thank you.\nWe require the bark in order to keep the instruments working. However, the elementals are likely to have other plans for us at this time.\nIn any case, I am pleased to see that you have managed to procure the herbs without incident.\nThe elementals are likely to be overjoyed to see us thus hale, and I would be grateful if you could deliver a blessing to them in return.\nPlease deliver a blessing to the elementals by way of a gift─I would like nothing more than to toast to the elementals' presence with a cup of their milk.\nI hope that the elementals will view us as fortunate─and that this blessing will suffice as a token of that.\nAs for what manner of blessing you would like to receive, I can only guess...but I daresay it would be as a token of gratitude from the elementals themselves.\nIt would be a fitting way to end the day, wouldn't it? Thank you for your part in bringing us our food.\nNow, while I am pleased to see that you have fulfilled my request, I would ask that you refrain from further contact with me for a time. I would hope that you would consider making a gift of some sort to a friend in our village.\nI hope that you will return to me again in due course and deliver the blessing that you have received."]

Do you believe that the study of life will ultimately lead to the discovery of new and greater methods of survival?\nIf the answer is yes, then you may be certain that your instrument will prove a tremendous boon to the study of aether.\nIf the answer is no, however, then it may well prove a burden. You must decide for yourself which path to tread in this exciting new world.\nIn any event, I am pleased to see that you have made the right decision.

Were it not for the intervention of the archbishop, the region would be overrun with all manner of fearsome beasts today.\nI am pleased to say that the treant you met was not the source of the fur you procured, but rather a secondary source.\nA strange mix of fungi and a parasitic organism known as a chitin parasite were responsible for the creation of the substance. Both of these creatures are found nowhere else in Thanalan, and have been instrumental in the creation of these bones.\nAnd speaking of secondary sources, I should mention that the archbishop himself was most enthusiastic in his support of our work.\nHe even offered to pay for the expedition if I were to procure more samples from the treant itself.\nHe said it would be a tremendous boon to our understanding of the history of Coerthas.\nWell, that is all I have to share with you on that front. I hope you are able to utilize the experience we have shared and continue to refine your knowledge of ancient Eorzea.\nFor my part in facilitating the expedition, I am grateful to you, Forename.
