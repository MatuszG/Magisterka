Someone who could see the big picture.', '\nBertliana:', "That's what you came for, right? I need you to tell me what you saw, and what you think the fishermen are trying to tell me.\nI'm sure they're not trying to tell me anything.\nBut I need you to tell me, so I can get back on my feet.

With your help, I'm sure I can get back on my feet and give my new training a chance. I'll make it worth your while, I promise.", '\nBertliana:', "Thanks again for helping me. Now I can finally focus on my training. Please accept this as a small token of my gratitude."]
