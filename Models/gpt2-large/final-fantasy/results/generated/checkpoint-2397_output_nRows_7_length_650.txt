Marcelain is an accomplished goldsmith of considerable repute, and his presence would be a tremendous boon to our efforts.\nAnd yet...it would not do to have our first blacksmith under our roof beset with distractions.\nI would be most grateful if you would take the time to learn more about Marcelain and his work. It would give me much to know of a fellow craftsman who shares my passion for quality weaponry.\nTake this letter to Marcelain, and he should be more than happy to oblige you.
