But the day he asked me to build it, I realized it was time I made a change.\nHe had told me that it was a tool for the guild, but to my mind, that was just the beginning. I knew there was much more to this instrument than what it could do.\nI wanted to make it my own─something that would show I had learned the craft.

He told me that I could never become a true craftsman.\nBut I was too young to understand what he meant─or why he had so much faith in me. He was always so kind to me.\nBut I was determined to change that. I wanted to do something for the guild, something that would make a difference.\nSo I decided to write a letter, asking for the help of a guildmaster. And so, a letter came. A letter from a guildmaster of the esteemed guild, who said that they were looking for someone like me.\nI was honored to have had a chance to hear their words.\nI wanted to send this letter to my father.
