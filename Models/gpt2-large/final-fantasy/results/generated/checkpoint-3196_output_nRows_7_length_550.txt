Dialogue: ['\nCarpenters:', "\nWe've got our work cut out for us, but I can assure you─not one beekeeper in Moghome will be outdone by this batch of mongrel.\nThe mongrel population continues to grow─thanks in part to an unduly strict culling policy, but mostly thanks to an unceremonious invasion by the sin eaters.\nTheir arrival has forced the abandonment of nearly all of the hives that once made up Moghome's beekeeping empire. Only a handful of hives remain in operation.\nMoghome's beeswax is the most coveted of all raw materials─it's used to make candles and the like. Unfortunately, the quality of the waxy substance is so poor that even the most skilled of weavers find it difficult to work with.\nIt's not just that the beeswax is poor quality, though. The bees also carry a parasite that's nigh-infestable─the mongrel gall. The parasite eats the waxy substance and turns it into a milky substance that it can suck from our hives.\nThe parasitic mongrel has made Moghome a veritable veritable bee-keeper's paradise, but it's no exaggeration to say that we've had to turn away a goodly number of potential customers simply because they can't be bothered to wait in line.\nIf we don't cull the mongrels soon, the colony will collapse, and we'll owe the sin eaters a handsome bounty.\nI can see it in your eyes─you've seen the mongrels for what they are. They're a nuisance, to be sure, but they're also a crucial part of keeping the bees buzzing here in good working order.\nThat's why I'm here, adventurer: I need your help to cull the mongrels, and I can promise you it'll be worth your while.\nOur moogle guide will explain the process in greater detail, but you need only ask for my name, kupo.", '\nPop:', '\nYou sense a hostile presence!', '\nCarpenters:', '\nYou are ready to begin?', '\nGuide:', "\nIt's been a while, Forename.

It brings me great comfort to know that my hard work has paid dividends.\nBut let us speak of that instrument. As you have doubtless noticed, the machines have been laying waste to the area near the Druthers.\nIt is my responsibility as Forename to ensure that they are removed. I would be grateful if you would take this harp and pick some suitable trees to set to rights.\nWhen you have finished, come and let me know. I will see to it that they are properly rewarded.', '\nSeverian:', '\nAh, Forename. I trust the harp has been cleared of any nasties?\nThank you. I shall pass on to you the details of the deed.\nWhen the machines first came to us, they were deranged and utterly beyond help.\nTo prevent them from coming to any harm, we constructed “iron harps.” They are no more “psychos.” but “giant bugs.”\nThe “psychos” were bred for their beauty and were used as familiars in the field. But they have a long and bloody history, one that began with the Flood.\nThe Flood made them absolutely vile, utterly without respect. They are one of the most abhorrent creations in all of creation─be they beastmen or man-made.\nThe destruction they wreak is beyond measure. But so long as we exist, we must put aside our differences and work together for the good of the realm.\nTo that end, I have decided to gift these iron harps to deserving adventurers.\nYou have my deepest gratitude. I shall see to it that they are properly rewarded.']
