I will join you once I am finished.\nDo note that in order to ascertain their whereabouts, you will need to pester the bandits.

And since I am in charge of the child's settlement, I will of course see to it personally.\nSo long as you bear me the amaro egg, I promise to see to it personally.\nIn any case, I thank you for procuring this precious egg. Here is a token of my gratitude.']

Welcome to Horizon, friend.\nThere is much and more I would speak with you about, but we must keep our audience with Master Matoya limited to this.\nYou wish to know about the Churning Mists, do you? Very well, let us speak of that which you already know.\nThere once lived a great wyrm named Azim. Long ago, he sealed three great crystals within the giant's belly, which remain to this day at the very heart of the Churning Mists.\nThese crystals are the keys to Azim's will and the means by which he traps mortals within his realm.

His name is Azim the Resurrected, and he awaits your answer.\n', '\nOswell:', '\nAzim the Resurrected awaits your answer?\nThen our great wyrm will once more appear before you.

His name is Azim the Warrior, and you will find him standing before you at the very center of the Churning Mists.\nWhile we do not believe he will return to our world, we have every faith he will remain a spirit like unto Azim and continue to watch over and protect us.\nPlease wait for him by the giant's side."]
