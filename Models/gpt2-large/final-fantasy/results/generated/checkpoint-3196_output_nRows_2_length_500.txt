While doing so, we must also destroy the pests that try to take our nectar.\nThe more nectar we gather, the more flowers we can pollinate, and thus the more flowers we will have to destroy.\nThe more nectar we gather, the more flowers we can pollinate, and thus the more flowers we will have to destroy.\nIt is a delicate balance, but we must maintain it for the long run.

If all goes according to it, I will make sure that the bees are getting the nectar they need, and the flowers are in good shape to pollinate.\nIf all goes according to plan, the bees will be back by now.
