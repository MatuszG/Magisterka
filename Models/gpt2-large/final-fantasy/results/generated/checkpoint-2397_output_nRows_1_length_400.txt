Dialogue: ['\nAmphelice:', "\nAh, you must be the adventurer I've been hearing about. Would you mind lending me a hand?\nI've been tasked with looking into an unusual transaction. I was sent to a merchant's establishment in the eastern part of Thanalan, and was charged with taking a package to an address of my choosing.\nThe shipment contained a magnificent set of ancient chivalric armor, and I was hoping to exchange it for something of equal worth.\nHowever, as I made my way through the city, I ran into a merchant─an Ul'dahn─who was peddling the armor. I had no choice but to turn him away, for fear of drawing undue attention.\nI'm not sure if this was a conscious attempt at deception, or simply a desperate attempt to inflate his price. Whatever the reason, I'm finding it increasingly difficult to find anyone who's willing to deal in my type of wares.\nThat's where you can help. For your part, you'll be taking the package to the Ul'dahn man, and trying to negotiate a fair price. I'll be watching from here.", '\nUl'dahn Merchant:', "\nGreetings, friend. Would you be up for a bargain?\nOh, you've got the armor! Let's see what you can offer me.\nHm? A great sword and a handsome suit of chivalric armor, for a great price? I'll take both.\nOh, and I believe I recognized the man─a merchant named Gundobald. From what I can tell, he's one of the wealthiest men in Thanalan.\nIf you're willing to part with the armor, you'll be getting a hefty discount. I can't see why you'd not part with it for a decent price.\nIf you

I've a favor to ask if you're willing to help out with a local boy's garden.\nI was recently approached by a lad named U'odh Nunh, and he offered to do me a favor by procuring seeds for me. However, I'm not entirely confident in my ability to procure them myself.\nIf you happen to be in the area, I'd be most grateful if you could deliver them to my friend here.", '\nBhirdraeg:', "\nPlease deliver these seeds to my friend here.", '\nUodh Nunh:', "\nI've been waiting for you, friend. You've brought me my seeds, and for that, you have my thanks.\nBut I must ask that you first procure some high-quality bark from a local tree─one of the more popular trees in these parts.\nThe tree grows to the northeast of here, and I'm told it grows to be quite the lumberjack. You'll find it easily enough by following the road north, past the hamlet of Bowrest.", '\nUodh Nunh:', "\nHow did you find me? I'm not sure I follow... Ah, the seeds! I'll have to plant them straightaway!\nYou've brought me a bounty of crops, and for that you have my thanks. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a task for you."]
