Dialogue: ['\nAlphinaud:', '\nHow fare you on the matter of the anemone? As you know, the anemone is one of the most important creatures in Ul'dah.\nIt is said that the anemone's skin is capable of absorbing the life-giving rays of the sun─a valuable commodity in a world without natural resources.\nIt is for that reason that the anemone has been accorded a measure of respect by the Ul'dahn elite─until now, that is.\nThey no longer deem it fit for military service, and so have decided to turn their backs on the beast.\nI am told that the decision has been made by those who hold Ul'dah's most valuable treasures─treasure which is themselves the source of great wealth.\nI fear that this leaves us only with one option: to track down the people who made the decision and ask them to reverse the decision.', '\nKakamehi:', '\nYou too?

Dialogue: ['\nAlphinaud:', '\nThe battle for Castellum Velodyna may prove to be the bloodiest yet.\nYet if we are to defeat the vile hive, we must needs contrive a means of entry.\nIt may be that a single ant may serve to deliver us into the hive, but that would be a foolish act of desperation. A more prudent approach would be to employ multiple specimens, each armed with a unique poison.\nI would have you harvest thirty of these queens from the surrounding area, twenty from the central highlands, and ten from the far western lowlands.\nWhen you have a sufficient quantity, bring them to me for analysis.', '\nAlisaie:', '\nAh, Forename. What news have you brought?\nOh, yes, the ant queens! Now that I think about it, I should probably tell you a little more about them.\nThe honeybee, like most insects, is a single-celled organism. While it is true that the queen is the most important part of the colony, her role in feeding and protecting the young is equally important.\nUnlike most other insects, however, the queen cannot carry a single egg on her own. Rather, each individual worker is fertilized by the queen's sperm, which is released from her abdomen when she is ready to lay an egg.\nWith the aid of these sperm, the worker can convert her body into a nest for the laying of the next.\nThe process is irreversible, and the worker is unable to be removed from the nest until the egg is laid. Thus, the Antecedent is the most important member of the colony, and the Antecedent's life is the most important thing that a bee cannot lose.\n...But I digress. The point is, having a means of entry into the hive is essential to victory.\nIf we are to overcome the hive, we must needs contrive a means of entry. A single ant, however, is not sufficient─we must have multiple specimens, each armed with a unique poison.\nThe hive's defenses are especially effective against bees that have recently mated. Thus, a single ant is likely to prove a fatal blow to a newly fledged nestling.\nIf we are to defeat the hive, we must needs contrive a means of entry. A single ant, however, is not sufficient─we must have multiple specimens, each armed with a unique poison.', '\nAlisaie:', '\nHow did you fare harvesting the queens?', '\nAlphinaud:', '\nWell done, Forename. In addition to their role as an entrance, the queens are crucial to our success.\nThe queen's absence would damage the young far more than a single death would. It is for this reason that we must have multiple specimens, each armed with a unique poison.\nI think it is safe to assume that you have successfully harvested thirty of the queens. Good work, Forename.\nNow, we may discuss the preparations for our entrance.\nI am pleased to say that the hive's defenses have greatly improved since last we ventured inside.\nI would not be surprised to see the hive's defenses crumble at any moment now. For this reason, I believe it will be necessary to change our strategy from within.\nI would have you retrieve a new type of poison from the hive. It is a most vital piece of our strategy, and I am confident you will be ready when the time is ripe.\nAs I mentioned, this new poison is most potent, and its appearance is most unusual.\nWhen I say “something unusual,” I do not mean that it is novel or even particularly unusual. Rather, it is an unusual and novel poison.\nI would have you retrieve it from the hive in question. If you succeed, it may prove an insurmountable obstacle to our entrance.\nRemember: we must have multiple specimens, each armed with a unique poison. The Antecedent is the most important member of the colony, and the Antecedent's life is the most important thing that a bee cannot lose.', '\

Dialogue: ['\nMogret:', "\nI'm sorry to trouble you, but might I ask you a question?\nI was recently approached by a group of soldiers─I think it was three or so, I was not sure─and asked if I would join them in a raid on some sort of lair. I said I would be honored to help, but I had no idea what they would come after.\nThey are a unit of the Vundu, I'm sorry to say, and I've never seen them before. I'm quite inexperienced as a huntress, and I doubt I would fare well against them.\nHowever, I know a man who might be able to help. You see, my comrade Kogret has a secret place where he keeps all of his weapons. I've tried asking around, but everyone─even my fellow soldiers─seems to think I'm crazy for wanting to go there.\nI know this is a stupid question, but would you mind coming with me and taking a look around?", '\nKogret:', "\nOh, I'm so glad you're here! It's a secret, after all, but I've been asked to keep it safe.\nI don't know what they're after, but I do know that weapons like my comrade's are never easy to come by in these parts. I'd be much obliged if you could go and look for them.", '\nKogret:', "\nI'm glad to see you've found them. Thank you for your help.\nI'm quite new to this whole hunting thing, and I'm terrified of going out hunting alone. Do you think you could join me in a few days?\nI'd be much obliged if you could find my comrade Kogret for me. I can't believe I missed the chance to thank him for his help."]
