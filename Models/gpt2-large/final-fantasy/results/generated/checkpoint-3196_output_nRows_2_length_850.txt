Dialogue: ['\nSeverian:', "\nGlad to see you returned safely! I had been pondering how to handle the situation when you arrived. I realize we both have a great deal to learn, but I believe I have a better idea now.\nYou see, the bees have been infested by a veritable hoard of stinging pests since mid-June. As the pests multiply, they become more difficult to control, and we have begun to see a decline in our honeybees' numbers.\nAt the same time, we have begun to see an increase in the number of aggressive bees─thinkers─who are more than happy to put down their foes rather than allowing them to harm our hives.\nFor the past two weeks, I have been attempting to stem the bleeding by taking it one step at a time. For example, I placed an order for pesticides on the day of the attack, but I've since canceled it. I would be grateful if you could deliver those pesticides to the apiary in my stead.\nI will await your return, and pray for your victory. Here, take this as payment for your efforts.", '\nSeverian:', '\nYou have my thanks. With your help, we will once again be able to keep the bees buzzing to the beat of our wings.\nThough I suspect you are wondering why I would aid you in such a manner. Well, I have a few reasons.\nFor one, I believe it is important that we take care of our hives in the short term, rather than allowing them to be destroyed by pests in the long term.\nIn addition, the victory you achieved today will allow us to more effectively communicate with the outside world. I am confident that we can accomplish our goals thanks to your help.\nLastly, I would like to extend my gratitude to you for saving the bees.

I have a task that could use your keen eyes.\nWe have just received a gift from the Order of Nald'thal, but I fear that it has already been given to some very poor creatures. The beeswax that adorns the pom-pom of these honored protectors was once the fruit of a sacred tree.\nThe tree may have withered long ago, but the protectors keep it alive by pollinating its fruit.\nTo ensure that their gift reaches its intended recipient, however, they must be cut down before they put the tree out to dry.\nThe pom-poms, which are made of the same material as the protective beeswax, are commonly found on the tails and undersides of buffaloes. Please go and collect them for me.\nThere is a herd of buffaloes that graze outside the cave. If you should find one while searching for the beeswax, please collect its fruit for me.\nThe tree is said to grow in the memory of a bough by a bough─a tradition that goes back generations. It is said that when a bough dies, its memory takes root in the memories of a newly born tree.\nI wonder if the protectors are able to remember the names of their protectors, or if they simply put the deceased tree out to dry.\nI am afraid I cannot tell you much of the history of the tree, but you have my deepest gratitude for making the effort.\nWhen I was a child, I was taught the names of the seven gods of nature─Hinu, Kuplo Kopp, Loporrit, Nidhogg, and Uin Hagan.\nBut the gods are honored far too highly by the Order of Nald'thal, and the tribute they bear from across the realm is too rich to be kept by one individual.\nNo matter how reverentially we honor them, however, they cannot replace our own names. It is only through sacrifice that we preserve the memory of our protectors.\nOne of my friends died while protecting the Greatwood from the sin eaters. His name was Lakshmi, and he was buried in the village square.\nTwo years ago, the trees that grow in the forest that he loved were felled. Their wood was scattered, and they have not been seen since.\nI wonder if they too have met with the same fate. I would like to remember them by planting a tree in their memory.\nPlease gather the wood from the trees that grow in the wood that friend once protected. Pluck a branch from each tree and place it in the grave with my blessing.\nI pray that the gods will allow me to continue the tradition of naming our protectors.\nPlease gather the wood from the trees that grow in the wood that friend once protected.
