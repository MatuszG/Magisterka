It was the scene of one of the bloodiest battles in all of recorded history, and its residents have been through a lot.\nWhen the Empire occupied Eorzea, they spared no effort to ensure the safety of the Ala Mhigans in their land. Indeed, they took every opportunity to make the other tribes jealous of their newfound riches.\nBut to this day, a few scattered Ala Mhigans refuse to accept the Empire's offer, and a few imperial defectors take exception to the fact that the holy land is being used for the imperials' personal gains.\nSo it's no small matter that we've been granted permission to settle within easy walking distance of the ancient battlefield. I do hope all goes well, and if there are any trouble spots, we can usually find them.\nI do wish the Ala Mhigans would see sense, but if they mean to continue fighting, there is no other choice but to accept the offer.\nThat's all I have to say about the good news.
