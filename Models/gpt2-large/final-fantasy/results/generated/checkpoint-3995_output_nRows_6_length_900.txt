However, the noble house is under the impression that the bird is for sale.\nWhat's more, the bird's been trained to carry a message for the House of the Fierce, the military wing of the Maelstrom. However, the noble house has no interest in the message and refuse any cooperation.\nNow, this may seem like a minor matter to you, but these birds are really important to the people of Il Mheg. They're native to these islands and were brought here as livestock.\nIf the message was to reach the House of the Fierce, it would be a tremendous boon to their cause. It would also put an end to the imperials' endless war machine.\nSo I'd like you to go and speak with the noble house and try to win their trust. If they refuse, well...that's it. That's the end of your investigation. You'll be back in one piece, I promise you that.\nIt's settled, then? Good.

Perhaps in the future he'll send someone to bring me something more special, like chocolates or flowers."]

Title: A Bargain Struck
Dialogue: ['\nGildon:', "You've come at a good time, Forename. I've been looking for a reliable hand and I've settled on a rather unusual one.\nI've been tasked with procuring crystals from the local caves─primals and such─but I've also been asked to procure quantities of furs from the local hulking beasts.\nI've been charged with procuring fifteen chunks of raw furs, but the task may prove difficult for a beast-ridden land as this one is. If you would be so kind as to procure two chunks of their hides and a set of scales from the mammoths that roam the area, it would be a simple task.\n", '\nGildon:', 'Have you brought the furs and scales?\nExcellent! Well done, well done!\nI've heard these mammoth carcasses wander the area of late. You may be surprised to know that some of the meat from their hides is highly prized as it is highly salted.\nI will add this to the pile of spoils I've accumulated from my previous commissions and I'll be off to procure more crystals!\nI must say that I've never seen such fine furs before. I do hope you didn't encounter any trouble.\nThe crystals I've procured are of sufficient size to be used to amplify a Flame spell. I intend to use this new ability when my next commission arrives.\nI should mention at this point that the crystals I procured are of a different style from the others I've dealt with. They're round, notched, and rather than being jeweled, are of a dull gold.\nI will use these to enhance the efficacy of another spell. In the meantime, I suggest you remain in the Twelveswood and continue your training.']

Our latest creation is our latest masterpiece, the Kojin Gekko.\nBefore we can teach our new soldiers the techniques of our forebears, however, I believe it would be wise to imbue them with the knowledge of one of our own.\nFor this, I have petitioned the help of none other than Master Hamon. I know not how long he has been away from our doors, but I know he would be glad to lend a hand in completing this endeavor.', '\nHamon:', '\nAh, Forename─so good of you to come. We were all hoping you might come along.\nI am Hamon, and like all of my colleagues, I am a Kojin of the Blue.\nIn fact, I was born and bred in Kugane, but my life took an unexpected turn when I came to work at the Rokuyari Trading Post.\nMy duties eventually led me to this place, where I have since made my home. But even here, I could not help but reflect on my time spent with the Kojin.\nOne day, I came across a piece of information that piqued my interest. I immediately set to work concocting a means by which our forebears might be brought to their feet.\nIt was then that I knew─I knew I had found my man. And with this, my research into the techniques of our forebears has come to a close.\nNow, as I taught you, the Kojin are a people of many races and creeds. But to me, there is one thing that all share in common─we all love music.\nAs Master Hamon said, 'All Kojin strive to one day take their place alongside our forebears. And with your help, I am certain that I can make that dream a reality.']

It was indeed created as a gift for a soldier, but over time, I've come to see its value beyond the battlefield.\nThrough its use in battlefield applications, such as scent detection and healing, the ampelos has come to be an invaluable partner to the soldiers of the Studium.\nI do hope one day you can find a use for the creature besides serving it up in its current state.\nIf you ever want for more information, you can always visit the Orphanage at Dyrstweitz Airfield."]

Title: A Bold Decision
Dialogue: ['\nCiuna:', "I'm sorry, Forename, I couldn't help but think of your heroics on the battlefield. I couldn't help but think that the very same heroics you displayed on the battlefield could have provided the inspiration for your own bold decision.\nYou see, on the battlefield, there is no such thing as being too strong. Indeed, being too strong can be a strength's greatest enemy. If we are to outfight our enemies, we must be as powerful as they.\nBut to achieve this lofty goal, we mustn't neglect our training. Indeed, we must strive to improve both our strength and our skills.\nIn that regard, I would like you to attend a local training facility. There you will be able to hone your skills in preparation for the day's battle.\nI realize this may seem like a small step, but I assure you that it is a necessary one. As you are already so adept at wielding a sword, I don't believe it necessary to wait until the day's battle to begin practicing.\nIf there is anything you require from me, please be sure to come back to visit.", '\nCiuna:', 'I can think of nothing more important than the day's battle. Pray go on ahead and take your place by the training area.\nI believe I understand everything you need to know. I only ask that you pay close attention to the swordsmanship portion of the lesson.\nWhen you have learned the basics, I would like you to take on a challenge. Challenge your sense of propriety and seek out a foe of like nature.\nI realize this may seem like a trivial matter, but it is of the utmost importance that you do not allow your senses to be overcome.\nIn so doing, you will come to learn something about who you are and what you can become.\nIn the meantime, I suggest you visit the training area to the northeast.', '\nCiuna:', 'There you are. I trust you have learned something of the importance of challenge and propriety?\nI must say, I love the way you have grown in your ability to wield a sword.\nIn fact, I believe it is about time you learned how to properly hold a shield, Forename.\nIn that regard, I believe it is time you began practicing your shield technique.\nIt is, of course, a technique as much about defense as offense. Indeed, without the proper technique, even the stoutest of men can be no match for the might of a Fury-sent beast.\nSo I ask that you begin by seeking out a foe of like nature and challenge your senses.\nWhen you have mastered the technique, I would ask that you seek out a friend of Ciuna and challenge your senses once more.', '\nCiuna:', 'I can see now why you were so adamant about taking on a challenge. You have come a long way.\nNot only have you learned to wield a sword, but you have begun to understand the importance of shield technique.\nYou have taken my suggestion to heart. I only hope that you will use your newfound skills to their fullest potential the day of your battle.']

Errand Boy is in the living room, playing with the supplies. A few of the others are in the kitchen, preparing meals. You can't miss the boy, he's always with his nose buried in the books. I'm sure he's got a list of what he needs, but as this is Errand Boy's first time making anything, there's bound to be mistakes. Anyhow, I trust you've learned a valuable lesson from this experience. Errand Boy is a clever boy, but he needs a hand helping him pick out supplies. For this, I need you to go to the market and get yourself some apples. Three will be enough.", '\nTaina:', "Go and get yourself some apples at the market. Three will be enough.", '\nTaina:', "Ah, you're back. What was it you needed?\nAh, I see. Well, this should be enough. Errand Boy has learned his lessons well, but sometimes the best solutions aren't always the most obvious.\nThis is one of those cases. I wish I had more apples, but I don't. Well, what I can do is this: make him some cookies, and as a token of my gratitude, I want him to have the cookies."]
