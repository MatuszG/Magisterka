Title: A Brave Resolution
Dialogue: ['\nAlisaie:', '\nGiven all that has passed, it is hard to fathom how things stood when the Resistance first marched upon Doma.\nThe city was still burning, and Ala Mhigo had yet to be liberated. But our cause was not lost on the leaders─they understood the importance of victory.\nAnd so they ordered the defense of our nation's capital, even as they prepared for the inevitable invasion.\nBut by the time our forces marched upon Doma, it was already too late. The city was overrun, and all of Ala Mhigo was freed... except for those few who remained in Whitebrim Front.\nGiven what they believed would be the end of the Empire, my comrades in the Resistance held out hope that they might yet redeem us─that one last stand might be enough to set the nation aright.\nBut nothing could be further from the truth. The leaders' treachery knew no bounds─they ravaged the city to the last man, forcing the Resistance to take up their last remaining bastion in the field.\nEven now, some part of me wants to believe that we can still prevail... That one last stand will set things right. That one last stand will prove what we were made to fight for.\nBut I know that I am not enough. I must earn the support of my comrades, and I will do my utmost to earn it.\nYou have my word on that. Whatever happens, we will not rest until we have reclaimed what we have lost.\nLong may we live in peace, Lady Iceheart..."]

Dialogue: ['\nYugiri:', "The Allied forces have made great strides in their fight against the Empire, but there is still much to be done before they can retake Castellum Velodyna.\nThat is why I have asked the Scions to take up the defense of our people.\nLed by my comrade Commander Kempf, the men and women of the Scions will ensure that the people of Eorzea live to see the day when the Empire is no more.\nMy thanks to you, Commander! I will not rest until we have restored the honor of the Velodyna family.\nTo complete the restoration of the family's honor, we must needs drive the Empire out of our lands.\nBut our path forward is not all one way. We must be sure to listen and learn from our enemies.\nI have assigned each member of the Scions a task that will demonstrate their dedication to our cause. May they serve you well, my friend!", '\nYugiri:', "Welcome back, Commander Kempf. I trust you have learned a new task from Commander Yuzuka?\nAh, yes. He has asked that you visit him in the solar. I have already given you your task. I would see you now.", '\nKempf:', "Welcome, friend. To what do I owe the pleasure of your company?\nYugiri spoke of the difficulties our nation faces, and I agree. We must all do our part to preserve the peace.\nWith the Empire on the offensive once more, the time for waiting is over. We must act now to stop this threat.\nWith the Alliance and the Resistance at each other's throats, there is no choice but to fight or be killed. Yet we cannot afford to wait for the Garleans to make a final stand.\nThat is why I have asked you to escort my men home. For your sake, I pray that you will not have to use this opportunity to further divide our nation.\nI would not ask you to escort the Scions away from Castellum Velody

Dialogue: ['\nResistancegatekeeper:', "\nGreetings, sir. Will you be descending into the Yawn?\nI understand that it may not seem like much at first, but preparations for the ascent must be made.\nAs for where to begin─I would have you escort a pair of scouts to the southwest.\nThey will observe the Yawn from a vantage point to the northeast─that is, from where they can see enemy forces approaching from the west.\nShould you chance to encounter any imperial forces, I ask that you slay them and collect their bodies. That should prove sufficient to prove my point.", '\nResistancegatekeeper:', '\nThe scouts should be along the southwest road. Make sure you hurry─they may not be there long.', '\nResistancegatekeeper:', '\nThe scouts should be along the southwest road. Make sure you hurry─they may not be there long.', '\nResistancegatekeeper:', '\nAh, you are returned. I trust you were able to find my scouts?\nAh, yes. Well done. I trust we can now move on to the resolution of the matter at hand.\nLest you wonder, the resolution of the matter is not at all difficult to comprehend.\nThe Resistance took an oath to serve the Empire no more─they have renounced their allegiance, and thus are no longer subject to its authority.\nIn fact, many within our ranks believe that renouncing one's allegiance is a necessary step in achieving true freedom. Indeed, renunciation is a core part of our creed.\nIt goes without saying that those who harbor ambitions to wage war against the Empire will not be welcome within our ranks.\nIn short, all who wish to serve the Resistance will be required to renounce their ties, and that is all."]

You are an adventurer, are you not?\nYou are an adventurer, yes? Then I shall show you inside the Resistance camp.\nIt is not much to look at, but it is filled with all manner of priceless artifacts. There is a great statue of the Warrior of Light, for example. I am sure you have heard of it.\nCollectors will pay handsomely for these works of art, as will their friends and neighbors. They will go to great lengths to ensure that their belongings are delivered safely to their final resting place.\nOf course they will not take their work home with them, but will instead deliver it to a person in their village who will take care of it. Now go on, take your work and leave me be. I am only too happy to show you inside.', '\nResistancegatekeeper:', '\nWelcome back. Art has been a big part of my life. It is important to me that it is displayed safely, so I hope you do not mind parting with a few pieces from your haul.', '\nResistancegatekeeper:', '\nThere are several pieces of art that I have recently acquired that I would have you deliver to a Resistance fighter in Ala Gannha.\nHe is a man named Haribehrt. You will find him just behind the counter at the north entrance of the village.\nHe will be pleased to receive these pieces of art, as will many other Resistance fighters. And one final piece of art that I would have you deliver is an alchemical concoction called “dream dust.” It is said to strengthen the soul, granting strength and courage to those who dream of fighting the Resistance.\nIt is said that those who dream of fighting the Resistance become dreamers, and that those who dream of nothing at all

Should you desire further details, I would be grateful if you could call on me.\nThe House of Commons has granted my request. I shall await word of your success.\nIt is now time for you to escort the unit to the front line. My congratulations on your arrival.\nYou are doubtless eager to see how the operation turns out. I assure you that your unit will not be the first to face the Garleans on the southern front.\nVictory is all but assured once Allied forces capture the Castrum Abania.

Oh, and before I forget─your unit is under attack!\nThough I would rather not waste your time with pleasantries, I must confess that I am flattered that you are here at all.\nYou see, I sent word to Camp Broken Glass that my men would be out in force, and that you would be welcome to join them.\nAnd since you are here, I thought I could use your assistance to further secure our positions.\nIt would not do to have our men withdrawn at this juncture, but there is no time to lose.

The Velodyna is further to the west, and the Solus is further to the east.\nThe third is the least heavily fortified, and should be relatively easy to take.

No, the decision to join the Alliance rests with the citizenry at large.\nOnce again, I must commend you on a most vital service.
