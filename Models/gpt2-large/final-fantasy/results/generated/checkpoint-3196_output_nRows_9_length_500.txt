Welcome to Byron's Bread─a humble, yet highly esteemed place where the finest pickles are made.\nI take it you have come for a job? Allow me to explain the workings of what goes into making the finest pickles.\nThe main ingredient in most pickles is garlic. Garlic is essential to any proper functioning of the body. As such, it is essential to keeping our mouths and noses working properly.\nIn order to remove as much of the garlic as possible, the juices must be removed through fermentation. This is done by adding the spoilage to the brine, and this process is repeated until the desired flavor is achieved.\nHowever, it is not all about making the best product. We also take care to create a positive atmosphere by keeping the customers happy.\nSome might call that a backbreaking task, but I assure you that it is an essential part of the job.\nIt is not always easy, but I would not trade all the work in the world for a single victory. I would rather give my all for the cause, and I would not trade my freedom for it either.\nThanks for stopping by, and I hope to hear from you again soon.']

They report that they have sighted an object large enough to house a man in the rubble.\nIt is entirely possible that this is not the Allied forces' handiwork. However, they have yet to make good on their threats. I would rather not waste valuable time attempting to guess what they are plotting.\nIf you should find this to be the case, would you return to the Resistance and inform them of what you have discovered? I would also like to see the object in question.\nIf you should find it to be anything else, please return to the Resistance. I will gather our forces and take what we have learned back to our superiors.", '\nResistance:', '\nPlease return to the Resistance and inform them of what you have discovered.

Dialogue: ['\nCeana:', '\nAh, Forename. I have a favor to ask of you.\nI sent word to Camp Cloudtop a while ago, asking if you would come to Skyfire Locks and offer your assistance.\nThe few of us who live here are all too aware of the dangers that await outside the gates, but knowing nothing of the beasts that prowl in the depths, I thought it best to alert you to the possibility.\nIf you are willing, head to Skyfire Locks and offer your assistance. I shall inform the others once you arrive.', '\nAlphinaud:', '\nAh, Forename. I trust you were able to secure a foothold?', '\nAlisaie:', '\nIt seems that Ceana has been keeping the faith.\nThough we cannot well hope to keep the beasties away forever, we can ill afford to wait until they come for us.', '\nCeana:', '\nThank you, Forename. I pray the Lancers will be able to find a way to pacify the Ixal.\nThey are a dangerous lot─the Ixal are known to lay waste to the environs they pillage. But we cannot allow ourselves to be distracted by their rampages by virtue of being here.\nNo matter how much we may wish to put down the menace, we must remain vigilant. I pray for your safety, Forename.']
