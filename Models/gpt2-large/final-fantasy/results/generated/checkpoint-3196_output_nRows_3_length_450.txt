We're going to keep the bees buzzing all the way from here to the Moon, so that when the time comes for the next harvest, we can all be ready for it.\nOur honeybees are the light of our hive, providing for the combs and frames that are spun every day. If we don't, they'll be laying dead by the roadside.\nBut the bees are only one part of the solution. We must think of a way to keep the mites from taking over the whole hive.\nThere's a species of mite that burrows into the combs of the honeybees. If we were to spray them with the poison pheromone, they'd have no choice but to leave.\nThe idea is to use this pheromone on the mites as they're laying their eggs. And since we know they're only going to lay one, we can use that as an opportunity to find and destroy the other mites.\nThe plan is to start with the bees, then move on to the mites. Once we've eliminated the whole brood, we can move on to the next stage.\nBut I can't do it all by myself. If you'd like to lend a hand, you could come and find me at the northeast corner of this isle. I'll be waiting for you.\n"]

Dialogue: ['\nBriardien:', '\nWe have not forgotten how well you served the Maelstrom, Forename.\nNow, however, you and your fellow adventurers are needed once again.\nI would ask you to deliver a gift to one of our allies─a figure of great worth, to be sure─but whom you know little and less of.\nI would have you deliver this to a man named Alphinaud. He is a former knight of the sultanate, now a merchant. You would be wise to pay your respects, as well.\nAlphinaud can be found just outside the Gate of Nald.', '\nAlphinaud:', "\nWelcome, friend. I take it you've come on behalf of Brother Braine.\n...What of it? What is it that you require of me?\nOho, a gift? I knew I recognized that familiar face. Well, well. I suppose I can't refuse my old friend a present, now, can I?\nThank you, my friend. Now, while I enjoy sipping on my wine, I would appreciate it if you could tell Brother Braine that I would like him to convey my gratitude to Alphinaud.", '\nBriardien:', '\nAlphinaud can be found just outside the Gate of Nald.', '\nBriardien:', '\nSo this is the man I have been seeking. He is a man of great wealth, yet he gives so much back to the Maelstrom. I cannot help but wonder what drives him to do this.\nRegardless, I am grateful for his generosity. It is not much, but please accept this as a token of my gratitude.']

Dialogue: ['\nEilis:', "Well, hello there. Forename, have you come for more of my mum's beautiful bells? I'm sure that if I hung 'em up myself, they'd be mistaken for a piece of Sahagin hunting equipment.\nBut no! I know what those bells mean to you, Forename, and I want you to have them. As long as I keep the tradition alive, I'll make sure the next bell gets to your lips before the next one.\nSo, what do you say? Do you want to hear the bells before the next one? I'll even throw in these beauties.\nThe bells are a part of my mum's heritage, and I'm always happy to pass along the tradition to the new generation. She calls me a provider, but I'm really more of a listener.\nI'd be ever so grateful if you could hang these beauties up in front of the door so my customers can see them. And when they come asking for the bell, tell them it means a lot to you.\nYou've really made a difference in my life, Forename. I hope you continue to uphold my traditions as well.\nI've also got some new bells to order. I'd be ever so grateful if you could hang them up in front of the door so my customers can see them. And when they come asking for the bell, tell them it means a lot to you.", '\nEilis:', "I'd be ever so grateful if you could hang these beauties up in front of the door so my customers can see them. And when they come asking for the bell, tell them it means a lot to you.", '\nEilis:', "Ah, I've hung the bells up for you. Did you like them?\nHmmm... These are by far my most precious bells, but I know that folk will mistake them for Sahagin.\nI feel I owe you an apology for that. I should've hung them up a little higher up, so they wouldn't be mistaken for Sahagin.\n

Dialogue: ['\nEsmond:', '\nI should not be surprised if you had to contend with hostile creatures on your journey. To make matters worse, I am finding myself without a suitable instrument.\nI am loath to ask such a thing of a stranger, but could you find a suitable piece of wood and craft me one?\nIt is the will of the gods that I have a lyre. Of course, I will need to pay a visit to the udgan for the proper preparation of the wood.\nI am loath to ask such a thing of a stranger, but could you find a suitable piece of wood and craft me one?\nThank you. Here, take this. A token of my gratitude.', '\nEsmond:', '\nHow goes the search? Have you found the lyre I asked for?', '\nEsmond:', '\nHmmm. This is a fine choice.\nI must confess, the search was not easy. The udgan was insistent I use only one instrument.\nBut as fate would have it, it was not long before another journey brought me to your humble abode. I could not help but reflect upon what it means to be humbled.\nAs a performer, I must be humble in order to bestow my art upon the world. I am loath to let down my audience, but there is nothing more I can do.\nI thank you for your help. Please accept this as a token of my gratitude.']
