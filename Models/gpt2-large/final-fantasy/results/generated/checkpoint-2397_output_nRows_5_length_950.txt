I am glad to have you with me.\nYou see, I am charged with the murder of my employer, and my escape is the main reason I fled.\nI did everything in my power to escape─including hiring mercenaries to do the work. However, they would not turn their weapons on me, and I knew they would turn against me if I attacked them myself.\nThat is why I asked you to assist me. I knew you would not turn your weapons against me, and I knew you would not turn your back on me.\nIf the Eulmoran army finds out I am not who I say I am, they will take me alive and put me in prison for war crimes. That is how I intend to make my name, and that is how I intend to die.']

Title: A Bold Decision
Dialogue: ['\nAlphinaud:', "I'm in favor of making a bold decision, but I wouldn't do it myself.\nThe Order of the Twin Adder's been entrusted with a task: to track down and apprehend a member of the White Rams─a man known only as “M'naago,” for reasons that will become clear shortly.\nHe is currently in the process of capturing an ensorcelled statue, and, if things continue to go as they are, I doubt that he will spare us the trouble.\nAt the very least, we should try to lure him into a position where he is forced to make a choice─a choice between his life and the statue. I mean no offense, of course, but M'naago has never been one to take risks.\nA bold choice indeed, but I don't see how we can even hope to catch him if we don't try.", '\nM'naago:', "You're back! Might I ask you a question?\nWh-What's that!? It's nothing, I promise you!\nI-I'm not─ Don't touch me!\n...Well, of course, it is nothing. I was merely following orders.\nAh, but wait! I've never seen you so excited before. I-I thought you might have an inkling of what I was about to ask.\nI wanted to know if you were familiar with the “Mana-Egi,” a device which was first introduced in the western world following the appearance of the first crystal─and which has since been adopted by the Order of the Twin Adder.\nIt is essentially a crystal with a soul, which, when combined with the mind of an ensorcelled statue, can grant wishes.\nThe “Mana-Egi” is something of a synthesis of ancient and modern techniques, and it is this fusion of ancient and modern that the Order of the Twin Adder is most keen to employ.\nYou will be fascinated to hear more, I hope.\nNow, I suppose I can explain things in greater detail if you are willing to wait. The “Mana-Egi” was created to facilitate such wish-granting, and the more powerful the crystal, the greater the wish.\nA crystal of such power must be kept safe─and that means safeguarded from the elements─so that the wishes of the people of the future can be granted.\nFor this reason, the guardians of the Maelstrom are charged with keeping record of all wishes granted, and keeping them safe.\nThe guardians of the Maelstrom are charged with keeping record of all wishes granted, and keeping them safe.\nIt is for this reason that the Maelstrom has established a branch in Gridania─the “Alphinaud Branch,” in accordance with orders from the archbishop.\nNow, if you're willing to wait, I suppose I can explain things in greater detail if you are willing to wait. The “Mana-Egi” was created to facilitate wish-granting, and the more powerful the crystal, the greater the wish.\nA crystal of such power must be kept safe─and that means safeguarded from the elements─so that the wishes of the people of the future can be granted.\nFor this reason, the guardians of the Maelstrom are charged with keeping record of all wishes granted, and keeping them safe.\n...And you, Forename, are charged with protecting the crystal, yes?\nThank you, for everything.\nYou've done more than enough to protect the crystal, and for that you have my gratitude.\nNow, I suppose I can explain things in greater detail if you are willing to wait.

Title: A Bold Decision
Dialogue: ['\nDmitar:', "\nI'm happy to report our soldiers have dealt another heavy blow to the Empire's forces.\nOur front line has again pushed forward, and seized another outpost at Old Bozja. My commanding officer has asked that I take you to the site. Please take care, and follow me.", '\nDmitar:', "\nI'd like you to take this M-COMPACT M-28E3 machine gun to Old Bozja and hold on to it while we take a look around. I'll join you in the field once I'm finished with my investigation.", '\nDmitar:', "\nIt's a relic from the days when the Empire ruled the roost, and it's one of the few weapons we've recovered from the Garleans' abandoned facilities. I'll need you to keep it pointed in the right direction while I take a look around.\nThe M-COMPACT M-28E3 is an autoturret. It's designed to take a wide variety of weaponry, and has been instrumental in countless engagements with the Empire's forces.\nThe thing is, the Empire developed a new type of armor that, while not entirely new, was significantly more advanced than anything we've seen thus far. I'm fairly certain we've scoped in on the exact design we've been sent to investigate.\nI can't say for sure how much the armor weighs, but it's massive─much larger than any we've seen thus far.\nI'd wager this is the main body of the armor. It looks like it's made of some sort of crystalline alloy, but I can't be certain.\nMy guess is the crystal is what gives it its strength. If we can crack this armor's crystal, we might be in for a surprise.", '\nDmitar:', "\nThis is the crystallized core of the M-COMPACT M-28E3. It looks like it's filled with some sort of dark matter.\nIf we can break this apart, we might be able to find what's inside. And that would be a rather important find, wouldn't you agree?\nIf we can't crack this armor's crystal, we won't be able to take a read of anything inside.
