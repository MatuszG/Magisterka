Dialogue: ['\nKerst:', "\nYou there, adventurer. Do you have any spare wood for the woodwind chime? It's my father's favorite.\nWhen he was working as a woodworker, he made a habit of visiting the guild. I was hoping he might bring back some wood for me.\nIt's not easy to find any of the wood from the trees that grow near the Churning Mists. I've tried asking around, but no one seems to know anything.\nIf you could search for some near the Churning Mists, I'd be ever so grateful.\nThere are three locations here─by the water, by the lake, and by the cave. Try your best to search for the wood.", '\nKerst:', "\nThere are three locations here─by the water, by the lake, and by the cave.

As the name suggests, it's meant to amplify the sounds of wind through the wood.\nThis chime is meant to be played by a single person, but it's a shame that I can't make use of it myself.\nI can't imagine it's easy to find an empty seat in the Churning Mists, though. Thank you for your help."]
