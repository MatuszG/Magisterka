I'm told you're on patrol, and as such I've been asked to make a report to Master Matoya.\nI've already sent word to the Wailers, but I fear you will be the one to deliver it.\nI expect you have already heard of the Ishgardian Resistance, so I won't waste your time. You need only know that the Garleans were attempting to seize the Castrum Meridianum.\nIn the meantime, the Order of the Twin Adder sent word that they were setting up a base of operations within the city. They were planning to occupy the Castrum Meridianum and make preparations for an assault on the Garleans' main forces in the region.\nThe Twin Adder's contact in Ishgard, Ser Marcelain, has asked that you assist in facilitating the evacuation of the citizens.\nIf you would join the operation, speak with Ser Marcelain, and he will direct you to the Castrum Meridianum.", '\nMarcelain:', '\nGreetings and salutations, adventurer. What business have you here with the Twin Adder?', '\nMarcelain:', '\nYes, I am Ser Marcelain, and I can tell you are a busy man. Do you have a moment?\nMaster Matoya has asked that you join the operation to evacuate the citizens. I expect you will need to travel to the Castrum Meridianum to assist in facilitating the evacuation.', '\nMarcelain:', '\nI understand. May I show you in?\nThank you for coming, Master Matoya.\nThe Castrum Meridianum overlooks the city from its position atop the Castrum Sagittari.\nWe needn't concern ourselves with the Garleans' movements within the city─the evacuation process will be handled by the Order of the Twin Adder.\nI can assure you that they will do everything they can to facilitate the evacuation.', '\nMarcelain:', '\nWe should all thank the Twin Adder for their assistance. I must say, it's been quite the while since we've received such a timely report.', '\nMarcelain:', "\nA blessed instrument, you say? Well, I'll be damned if I'm not going to show it to Master Matoya.\nNow, let's hurry─the Wailers should have word of the operation by now. You'll want to go and see them before you head back to the Wanderer's Palace.", '\nUrianger:', '\nI see you made quick work of the Garleans.\nIt seems the Resistance is no more, and the Garleans no less.\nI must say, I'm impressed. I never thought I'd be glad to see our esteemed allies again.\nThough I must admit, I did take my time with the briefing. I must have missed a vital piece of information─the Garleans were not planning on invading the Castrum Meridianum.\nIt may seem trifling, but the evacuation of the citizens should prove an incredibly valuable service to our nation.\nIt is my hope that you will be of service to the Resistance when next you visit us. Farewell, adventurer, and may Halone grant you peace in the here and now.']
