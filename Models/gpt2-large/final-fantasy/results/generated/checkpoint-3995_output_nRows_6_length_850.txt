I know I shouldn't have to ask, but there's just no telling what he might do to a child his own age.\nYou'll recall that I told you of my desire to have my own son. Well, it's finally time.

He must first prove he can be trusted.\nI've already given him a pair of earrings to help show his support. They're made of silver, and are meant to help him remember the men he's sworn to protect.\nNow it's up to him to prove he can be trusted. He can't possibly turn his back on the people of Camp Drybone.\nHe's been brought up well, but he's like to be overcome with emotion if he meets his father for the first time. I want him to be confident, and I want him to hold on to his sword until the moment he takes the ring.\nWhen he takes the ring, he should be able to look me in the eye and say, “This is who I am. This is who I fought. This is who I will be.”\nPlease, Forename. You've heard me say it before, but I need you to do it for me.

I would be much in your debt if you could find out for me.\nI'm also hoping you might inspect the room I've just mentioned. There seems to be an old chest there belonging to one of our guests, though it's ragged as well. Could you go and look for it?\nIt's not much, but it's got a lock.

It's one of the things I miss the most about having to look after the children─I used to be so busy looking after them myself, I barely had time to take a single bath!\nAs you can see, this wardrobe is quite precious. It was only made last year, so I'm quite certain it's the only one of its kind.\nIf someone were to offer me a similar gift, I'm sure I'd be more than happy to accept it. And thanks to you, I was able to find out who our guest was!\nI don't know how to thank you enough, but please accept this as a token of my gratitude!"]
