We had to watch our backs each time a Garlean ship passed nearby, and even now we're under the watchful eye of the Maelstrom.\nStill, I suppose we have a choice─we could simply move the watchtower somewhere more suitable, but I like the idea of having a few extra bottles of marmot blood around for when the going gets tough.\nThank you for your help!

Ordinarily, I'd be loath to ask for more, but I feel obligated to say a prayer for my good health.\nBut to pray for one's own well-being is no small undertaking. I know not how I can possibly hope to do it alone...\nIn the meantime, I've been asked to prepare a gift for my patron. I've chosen to go with a favorite instrument─a flute. It's simple enough to play, and it's all I have to perform at the moment.\nWould you be so kind as to prepare a flute for me? Four small bells should suffice to─\nOoh, a lovely sound! Yes, yes, and yes! I know exactly what to expect. I shall be pleased.\nThe patron is waiting right here. I can tell she's pleased as peas in a pod!", '\nAimebert:', "\nI'm pleased to say my patron is satisfied with the gift I gave her. And as for you...I trust the gift you made was as lovely as the flute you chose.\nI'm sure she will be pleased to hear that.

It is my responsibility to make ready for the visitations we will be making to the Adders' Nest.\nI would be most appreciative if you could procure the tool from my father for me. I will see that it is delivered to Wolkan.\nMy duties demand that I keep a sharp lookout for visitors, but I assure you that I am as ready as I will ever be.", '\nWolkan:', "Welcome to the Adders' Nest. Father has told you all about the instruments we plan to use today. It is time we began using them.\nLet us begin by taking the sylph elder's horn to the square. While it is customary to bow before your patron, it is not always the case.\nAfter the bow has been secured, the user must bend at the hips, keeping the blade level and the grip steady. Only then can the user perform his or her duty.\nNow, the sylph elder's horn is of the highest quality. The wood is long and narrow, allowing the bow to be precisely suited to each task.\nWith this in mind, I would ask that you test the windlass on the squirrels' nest to the east.\nIf it performs as expected, we can proceed with the offering. If not, then we will need to revert to the old method of employing the windlass with a dagger.\nThe Elder Seedseer will be apprised of any issues that may arise.\nYour father has given you the tools, I trust? Pray give them to her, along with the horn, so that she may be properly apprised of any issues that may arise."]

I'm an instrument maker by trade, and Fufucha is my partner.

I'll prepare the powder, and together we can make a powder that will suit your needs.\nNow, I suppose you'll be wanting this powder. It's a vital ingredient for any kind of crafting.\nIt's essential that you understand the importance of researching your materials thoroughly before you begin your work.\nThe sooner you can begin, the better!

It's not as if I need to convince you of that─I've already given you the necessary information!\nNow, you'll notice that the wood you've brought me is quite uneven. This is to be expected, given the manner in which the lackey has mixed the powder.\nLately, we've been finding that most of the materials we use for our instruments are harvested by those who live and work within the Black Shroud.\nIt's a wonderful world out there, where the rich variety of life is as much a part of our daily lives as food and clothing.\nTo be able to live and work in peace, however, is not always easy.\nThat's why maintaining good relationships with the people around me is so important. And you've made a great contribution to my life. Please accept this as a token of my gratitude.']

She has her own way of looking at the world, and I'm lucky to have her.\nI'll be telling her about all that I've done at the church, and hopefully she'll learn to look upon my choices with a little more wisdom.\nI think the best part of all, though, is that my daughter will be able to pick out the harp at my wedding.

Dialogue: ['\nTaciturn Temple Knight:', "You're the one everyone's been talking about, Forename. It's about time someone honored your accomplishments with a special gift.\nThe art of fusing crystal and flesh is an ancient one, originating from the primals' homeworld.\nAlthough the practice has since spread to our own star, it took an already-impressive Allagan weapon to see our colleagues take their rightful place alongside the finest weapons of the realm.\nSo you'd be forgiven for thinking this was a simple task. Wrong. The process is anything but.\nYou'll be provided with an Allagan tomestone, a device that will allow you to record your every interaction with the weapon.\nI should point out, however, that this is no ordinary tomestone. Rather, it will allow you to attach a token to the end of your weapon's blade, allowing you to further enhance your bond with the weapon.\nA token can be obtained by speaking with the weaponsmith who made the weapon, along with the asking of another of equal worth.\nIt is up to you which token you choose to use, but I thought you might appreciate the wisdom of the elementals in this matter.\nFor my part in the selection, I chose a simple gold blade adorned with a simple crossguard. The idea was that a well-wrought blade would lend the owner's soul strength, while a plain one would symbolize wealth and authority.\nNaturally, the elementals had a final decision, and the decision was ultimately theirs. But in the end, they chose to honor a warrior who has made the ultimate sacrifice.\nI realize there is a temptation to feel pained by this choice, but it is you who have chosen this path. You have the power to do so much more than simply express your gratitude.\nYou have the power to heal, to protect, and to inspire. Use this gift, and use it in service of the elementals."]

As such, it would be both disrespectful and offensive to show them to others.\nThat is why I must make every effort to procure the feathers and the brush myself. I am not without my pride as an aetherial researcher, but if I cannot convince even half the people in Eorzea that my work is worthy, then I shall have no choice but to quit my research.\nThat said...I am humbled to admit that I may never be able to repay you for your generous gift.\nI realize that this is only a pittance to you, but please accept it as a token of my gratitude."]
