Dialogue: ['\nBujeg:', "\nWell, I'm off to a good start, I'll wager! A rather unique beast has been spotted wandering the area─one of a kind in this part of the Twelveswood, I'd wager.\nThere was a merchant caravan passing through Little Ala Mhigo not long ago. As the merchant chanced to pass through just after the settlement had been freed from the imperials, he happened to drop a shipment of exotic spices. The whole thing was a bit of a mess, but the goods were consigned to the care of this merchant, who I'm sure is eager to make a quick gil on the side.\nAnd now, that merchant has agreed to meet me at the Forgotten Knight─that's right, at the Forgotten Knight!\nHe's an old acquaintance of mine, a chapulain of the Black Iron Trading Company. He's been following me around ever since we first set out together, and he's agreed to meet me at the Forgotten Knight if I can convince him that the spices we've found are of great worth.\nThe Forgotten Knight is just to the northeast of here. Come, meet me there!", '\nBujeg:', "\nThere you are. Good to see you.\nI had been wondering when you'd come by. The Forgotten Knight is just to the northeast of here. Come, meet me there!", '\nBujeg:', "\nI hope the spices we've found are worth more than what I paid for them.\nThis is quite an extraordinary find. It would seem that the merchants from Ul'dah were not only shipping these spices, but a whole army of them.\nI don't know how they managed to transport so much all the way to the Crystarium, but I'm sure they had a great deal of help from the Resistance.\nI'm pleased to note that the whole shipment appears to be in pretty good shape. I'd wager that the merchant who made the delivery has a great deal of knowledge about what went into making these spices.\nI can't wait to see what the rest of this shipment will be used for. I'll wager it's going to be a treat to sample the fruits of the land from time to time..."]

Yet none have ever succeeded in bringing an entire nation to its knees.\nThat all change for the better is well and good, but to see it come about so quickly is impressive indeed. But we can but speculate on the nature of that change.\nOne possibility is that the beast tribes are awakening to the threat of the hive.\nThere is no shortage of evidence to suggest this is the case. For instance, recent clashes with the Amalj'aa have left the Steppe awash in nectar, which has been hailed as a welcome change from the stagnant waters of recent months.\nPerhaps the tribes are realizing that they cannot simply sit back and watch their borders be overrun by the parasitic monstrosities. Indeed, the recent skirmishes have served to remind us of the threat the hive poses.\nIt is precisely because the threat the hive poses cannot be ignored that we must plan to best the beast tribes in battle.\nA new strategy must be devised, one that utilizes the strengths of our allies in battle, and employs them to the fullest extent.\nThe Umasou have been tasked with devising such a plan, and I have prepared the requisite materials for their use.\nFor this purpose, I have procured the following: nectar from the Amalj'aa, a variety of flower seeds, and a variety of flower blooms.\nAs you can see, the seeds are commonly found in abundance in the southern reaches of the Steppe. The flowers, on the other hand, are more difficult to come by in the northern reaches, and I am in the midst of searching for one that grows there.\nI must also mention that the nectar and flower seeds can be harvested from the nests of feral ziz, which roam the Steppe in greater numbers than any other creatures.

When you have recited the incantations, present them to the resident scholar. I would not send you to the House of Splendors without this.", '\nBiggs:', "We couldn't have done it without you, Forename. Thank you.\nI wonder, is Cid the resident scholar?\nAh, yes, I think he is. He's a rather gifted scholar.\nHe's been teaching at the House of Splendors for some time now, and his research interests are many. I was certain that he would have an interest in our incantations, but I didn't expect he would be so eager to share them with us.\nI hope that he will be able to share our incantations with you as well.\nI must say, I'm quite pleased with the outcome of your little venture.\nYou have a gift for me, Forename. It would seem I was right to entrust the delivery to you.\nTake it, and let Cid know that I am pleased as peas in a pod."]

Dialogue: ['\nBarryn:', "\nYou're an adventurer, aren't you? You're not like the rest of them bloody cowards─just plain bloody clever!\nI've got a job for you, if you're interested in getting paid to do it. A band of robbers have taken up residence in an abandoned building west of here, and they're making a nuisance of themselves.\nI can't leave my post, so I'd best get them all disarmed. But I need you to take care of this job, and get them out before they do anything foolish.\nThe robbers hail from the ruins to the northwest─that's where you'll find them.", '\nBarryn:', "\nThe bandits are in the ruins to the northwest─that's where you'll find them.", '\nBarryn:', "\nOne of the bandits has dropped a bomb─that's all I need to know! You'll get to know them better when you get to know them.", '\nBarryn:', "\nThat was a bloody waste of─ Oh, you're back. I was worried you'd run off on your own.\nI was right to worry─the bandits are no more clever than the rest of them. They're all the same bloody novices who think they're tough just because they're not. They're not worth pissing your own hornets' nest.\nBut you're different. You're smarter than the rest of them. You know better than to try something foolish. And you're willing to put your neck on the line.\nYou have my thanks, adventurer. I'll remember you as a friend."]
