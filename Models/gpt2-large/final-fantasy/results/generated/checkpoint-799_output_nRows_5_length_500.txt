Title: A Bold Decision
Dialogue: ['\nSeverian:', "\nAh, Forename─the first time I've seen you since the war. A pleasure to meet you!\nI am Severian, the head of the Scions of the Seventh Dawn. I am also the one responsible for the creation of the Garleans' newest weapon, the Revenant's Toll.\nThe decision to develop this weapon was made by the Scions themselves, I believe.\nAfter much deliberation, they decided to go with the latest technological advancement─a biocontractile coating, as it were.\nThis coating, I believe, was designed specifically to prevent the reagents that would be used to synthesize the weapon from being absorbed into the weapon itself.\nWe had to make a choice: we could develop the weapon, or we could abandon the weapon.\nWe chose the latter, of course, but we still have a few things to discuss.\nWe will leave the decision on your own, but if you would have any further questions, I would be more than happy to answer them.\nAnd now, on to the questions!\nWhat do you think? Do you think we should continue developing the weapon, or abandon it?\nThe decision is yours, Forename. There is no denying it.\nDo not worry─I shall be with you the rest of your life─just let me know when you are ready to make your decision.\n...But don't worry─I will not hold your hand!\nI will speak with the Scions again, and see what they think of your decision. Let us return to the base, and meet again once you are ready to make your decision."]
