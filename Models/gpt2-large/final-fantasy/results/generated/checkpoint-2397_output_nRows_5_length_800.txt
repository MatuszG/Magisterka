Title: A Blessed Instrument
Dialogue: ['\nMogzun:', "\nAh, I've been waiting for you, adventurer! If you're looking for work, I'm a man with a mission.\nI need two pieces of ancient bone from the region known as the Brume. They're not easy to come by, as the beasts that roam the area are so dangerous, and I'd never even consider hunting one myself.\nI'd ask you to gather them for me, but I know you're busy with other things, and I fear I'd be wasting my time if I sent you out to do a man's work.

Well, I'll be sure to pay you for your help when you've finished.", '\nMogzun:', '\nDid you have any trouble finding the bone?\nYes, these are perfect! Now, I must make a pot to show off my newest creation.\nI wanted to make a bone harp, but the bones I had on hand weren't quite large enough. To make the instrument larger, I needed to grind several bones together.\nThe Brume is a place where we can do just that─with the help of a local hunter, of course.\nWe grind the bones together using bones found in the area, and the resulting product is something called a “bone stew.” It's said that the bones here are said to have been brought from the Brume itself, and that it's where the bones of the great wyrm Nidhogg were first mixed.\nThe bone stew we're making is said to be the key to defeating Nidhogg─and it's my hope that this will do just that.\nI hope you'll come back and visit us again soon. Thank you again for your help, adventurer!']

Please hurry back before he starts eating anyone else!", '\nNu Mou Culinarian:', "It might be a while before you find the creature who ate my friend. Please hurry back before he starts eating anyone else!", '\nNu Mou Culinarian:', "My friend's been eaten by a variety of beasts. Please hurry back before he starts eating anyone else!", '\nNu Mou Culinarian:', "You've found my friend? Wonderful! Now I can finally get back to my post.\nWe Nu Mou are extremely clever creatures. We often take what we need from the environment around us, but sometimes we have no choice but to eat the creatures that prey on us.\nMy friend's eaten quite a few of those beasts this day. I'm sure he'll be eager to meet you again soon!"]

Dialogue: ['\nAlys:', "I am pleased to report our scouts have sighted no fewer than three dragons in the area.\nYou'll find them to the northeast of here. I hope they've been dispatched to the area for some manner of reconnaissance.\nI have also received word that some kind of barrier has been erected over the site. It appears to be some sort of magitek armor, though we have no way of knowing for certain what purpose it serves.\nI will see to it that it is removed forthwith. When I am finished with my duties, I shall report to the commander.\nIn the meantime, I would ask that you take this opportunity to improve your battle-readiness.\nWith so few dragons in the area, it is doubly important that you do not let your guard down. Take this flask of dragon-laced healing powder and fill it with water.\nIf you are to be successful in your mission, you must not only outfight your opponents, but outlast them. For this, you will need to regularly review your tactics, and review them often.\nYou will find the dragon-infested ruins northeast of here. I would ask that you take this flask of dragon-laced healing powder and fill it with water.", '\nPop:', '\nYou sense a hostile presence!', '\nAlys:', "Good to see you safely returned. Were you able to learn anything of note?\nAh, the dragon-infested ruins. I was beginning to worry that we'd simply be drawn into a fight we couldn't win.\nHowever, such is the nature of our duties here, and I am glad to see that we were able to reduce the threat.\nThis is the first we've encountered in the area, and it would not surprise me to learn that they have a purpose in this region.\nAt any rate, I thank you for your help. It would not have been possible without you."]

Dialogue: ['\nGildon:', "I can't say I'm surprised. It's not every day I see a youngling knight with an affinity for the sword.\nBut this time...\nI've seen far too much adventuring to take my eyes off this adventurer. I'd wager that he's one of the best in the realm.\nBut when you consider his age─and the fact that he's a quarter-breed, by the by─it's entirely possible that he's wandered into a no-man's land, unable to navigate the perilous terrain that lies ahead.\nIf you're willing to undertake this perilous journey with him, I would ask that you first speak with his mentor, the esteemed blacksmith U'jughal.\nU'jughal can guide you through the wilderness, but he is barred from revealing his whereabouts.\nThat said, you should be able to find him in his workshop in southern Thanalan.", '\nU'jughal:', "Gildon sent you, did he? Well then, let's get right to the matter at hand.\nI've been pondering how best to best this lad.\nHe's been training with me ever since he was able to wield a sword for himself. And he's proven himself a capable and efficient tactician.\nBut it's his decision to take the road less traveled.\nHe could be a great one for the role, but I don't think he's ready to carry the full burden of the Holy See.\nI'd rather he learned the ropes from a more experienced hand. That's why I've asked U'jughal to prepare him for the role.\nAnd he's done a fine job.\nI was right to call upon him. Now, if you'll excuse me..."]

Dialogue: ['\nHamon:', '\nHail, adventurer! Might you perchance assist me in gathering supplies for our journey to Ul'dah?\nAs you may have heard, the city-state has been at war for quite some time.\nI would be grateful if you could procure a quantity of dried lizard meat for our carnivorous friends.\nThe meat can be had from a variety of sources, but I would be most grateful if you could procure it from the area east of Camp Tranquil.\nTake a moment to search the area east of Camp Tranquil. You should find a variety of lizard meat, as well as the dried lizard scales I asked for.\n', '\nHamon:', '\nThe meat should be readily available in the area east of Camp Tranquil. Please hurry and procure it before it spoils!', '\nHamon:', '\nAh, you have returned. Were you able to procure the lizard meat as I asked?\nExcellent work. My carnivorous friends will be pleased indeed to receive such a tasty meal!\nLizards are said to possess certain...properties. Indeed, we are in the midst of preparing a lizard meat stew, but as you can see, the gathering of these various items has proven to be an unenviable task for us thus far.\nThat is why I am pleased to see that you are able to bring us food in spite of yourself. You have my sincerest gratitude!']

Title: A Bold Decision
Dialogue: ['\nCeana:', "We have a situation that calls for boldness. If Master Garlond is to be believed, we have a new chocobo─a black chocobo, no less─who has made a name for herself in the Chocobo Forest.\nAs Ceana is one of the forest's more experienced observers, she is eager to make a thorough investigation.\nI would have you go to the forest and see if you can ascertain who is in charge of the chocoboke's breeding. I am confident that you will find an accomplished and resourceful individual.\nIf you succeed in tracking down the chocoboke's parent, I would ask that you take the bird back to Reunion. You will find the chocoboke's parents in the Chocobo Forest, to the northwest of Reunion.", '\nPop:', '\nYou sense a hostile presence!', '\nCeana:', "Ah, Forename, the black chocobo has returned! To what do I owe the joy that he is no longer our lost chocobo?\nWell, I hope that he was not mistaking the green for black. Or that he is simply confused, for that matter.\nStill, we can hardly blame the bird for making a wrong turn. The forest is a labyrinth of secrets and we cannot afford to take our eyes off the prize at the first sight of a chocobo.\nBut let us at least take solace in the fact that the black chocobo has now made a name for herself as a hunter in her own right.\nI should hope that her parents will be pleased as peas.\nAh, but I must return to my bird. Ceana will await you at Reunion.", '\nCeana:', "Thank you for your help, Master Garlond.\nI will have you know that Ceana's observations were most helpful.\nI have learned much from her.\nWhat was it that she witnessed? Why did she feel that the green was somehow...less vibrant?\nI cannot say for certain, but I suspect that it was the presence of the black chocoboke that unsettled her.\nIt could have been anything─the way they approached you, the way they flew... I cannot rightly say for sure.\nI shall gather more information and put it to the chocoboke's parents. Thank you once again for your help."]
