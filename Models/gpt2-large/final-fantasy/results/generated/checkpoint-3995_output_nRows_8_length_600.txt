And it would give me hope that, despite all that's happened, Daimbert's still got a bright future ahead of him.\nSo please, spare a thought for Daimbert at the next meal. Just thinking about it makes me so sad..."]

Dialogue: ['\nMinfilia:', "I must confess that while working on the Resistance weapon, I came across an old song entitled “A Blessed Instrument.” I am unsure if I heard correctly, but it seems the Resistance weapon is named for a tool used to craft holy instruments.\nApparently, the weapon was first crafted by none other than the Monetarists of Sharlayan, who used their knowledge of alchemy to create the holy oil for their holy instruments.\nI am sure you have an inkling of where this is headed, but suffice it to say, it is a fitting name for a Resistance weapon.\nNow, though the song refers to a tool, it is not entirely accurate. While there is no denying the Monetarists' mastery of alchemy, there is no denying that tools can also be used to craft other types of holy items.\nFor example, you will not find any Resistance weapons using metal parts, but there are plenty using wood or horn. There is no reason why the Resistance cannot make use of these other types of materials.\nSpeaking of which, there is one more thing I would like you to inspect.\nThis is the vase that was in the possession of my predecessor. Though it looks like it has not been touched since before the Calamity, I can assure you it has not been left to sit idle in the cold for too long.\nI would be lying if I said more relics were not in the possession of my predecessors, but it is time I moved on to more recent relics.\nIn the meantime, there is something I would like you to take a look at.\nA selection of ancient coins is in the possession of my predecessor.

Dialogue: ['\nTataru:', "\nIf you haven't yet, you should learn the Manderville art of parley. It's surprisingly effective─so long as you stick to topics you know well.\nThe other day, I was discussing the recent spate of earthquakes with some of the town's residents. One of them, a man named Masatsuchi, asked me if I would be willing to host a dinner for the people displaced by the tremors.\nI thought it a rather odd request, but one I could not refuse. After all, the people of my homeland are not wont to turn their back on friends and family.\nI have been charged with organizing the event, and I would be most grateful if you could help me by asking the residents of the Rakuza District in western Kugane to attend.\nOnce you have gathered the necessary number of signatures, deliver them to the offices of the Rakuza District's resident caretaker. Present your petitions to the resident caretaker, and he will see that the relevant officials are made aware of the situation.", '\nMasatsuchi:', "\nA dinner for the people displaced by the tremors? That's a rather unusual request I haven't heard of before. I haven't the slightest idea who might be interested in such a thing.\nBut if you do come across the people in question, would you be kind enough to go and introduce yourself?", '\nTataru:', "\nThe residents of the Rakuza District in western Kugane should be made aware of the situation. Present your petitions to the resident caretaker, and he will see that the relevant officials are made aware of the situation.", '\nMasatsuchi:', '\nAh, you are here. I hope all goes well.', '\nMasatsuchi:', "\nIt is a pleasure to make your acquaintance. The resident caretaker is a man named Oto. He is responsible for ensuring that all the residents of the Rakuza District are provided with necessary care and attention.\nIt seems your efforts to gather the necessary signatures have paid off. I am pleased to say that I now have the authority to grant any sort of permission I deem necessary.\nBefore I give you any such permission, however, I would ask that you submit a request to the Allied forces in Limsa Lominsa.\nThey would not turn their backs on a friend in need. That is all I ask, really.", '\nOto:', '\nThe resident caretaker is Masatsuchi. Please make your way to the offices of the Rakuza District's resident caretaker.', '\nOto:', '\nThe resident caretaker is Masatsuchi. Please make your way to the offices of the Rakuza District

Dialogue: ['\nAirportinvestigator:', '\nIf you have the time, I require help with a report. While I have a capable man at my disposal, he is sorely undermanned.\nHe is stationed at the Quicksand, to the northeast of here. Seek him out, and he will brief you on the situation in question.', '\nFortinvestigator:', '\nI am the one who sent the envoy, if you have no other business.', '\nFortinvestigator:', "\nGreetings and salutations, sir. What brings you here today?\nA report from the Field Marshal? I'm flattered he has time to spare.\nWhile it details the current state of the Near East, it also contains a recommendation for how we might move forward. Quite a diverse read, I'm sure you will find the contents enlightening.\nWhile I can't comment on the wisdom of the Field Marshal's decision, I can say with certainty that the Allied forces will not surrender themselves without a fight.\nTo that end, the report calls for a combined effort between the House of Splendors and the Scions of the Seventh Dawn.\nI would not be surprised to see the two alliances come together, under the banner of the one great nation.\nBut whatever form it takes, I can only hope the people of Eorzea are able to unite in the battle against the Empire.\nYou have my thanks, Forename. Ever shall I cherish the memories of our explorations in the Far East."]

Dialogue: ['\nSorashs Koal:', "I'm loath to bother you, but could you perchance find a way to procure a bottle of karakul blood? I've no vials on hand, but I'm sure I'll find a use for it.\nA friend of mine─a man far more accomplished than I─is scheduled to visit the infirmary soon. I'm hoping to be able to provide him with something to sustain him for the time being.\nA word of advice: do not take more than a few vials of blood at a time. If you have to share your life with someone else, you best be sure to do so in moderation.", '\nSorashs Koal:', "I'm loath to bother you, but could you procure a bottle of karakul blood?

My thanks, friend.\nNow, the question is...how do I use this serum?\nI'll just get Sorashs Koal to mix it up, and then pour it into this cup.\nHe's no Father, but he's a good sort─he knows how to handle himself when the call comes.\nNow, the infusion process is no simple affair. One must contrive a means by which the serum can be drawn into the body, and that is where the alchemist comes in.\nAlchemists are a curious lot─I've had to explain my research to them more times than I can count. Still, they seem to understand the importance of discovery.\nSorashs Koal is due to visit the infirmary soon. It seems I'll have need of his blood soon.']
