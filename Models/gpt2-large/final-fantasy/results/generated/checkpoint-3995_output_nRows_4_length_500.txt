Dialogue: ['\nArdashir:', "\nAh, Forename! I was hoping you'd come by.\nYou see, word has it the Maelstrom has a new recruit on its hands─someone fresh and eager to make the acquaintance of a fellow adventurer.\nI won't deny he's had a few rough weeks, but he's strong and fierce like the rest of us, and if he puts his heart into the Maelstrom, who can say no?\nAnd I for one would!\nI've been in contact with the new recruit through skype, and he's promised to be a sight for sore eyes. He even told me his name!\nAnd from what I've been able to determine, he's a rather handsome young man with a strong presence. Aye, I can't wait to meet him!\nHe left the Reach a few days ago on his way back from a patrol. I'm sure he's headed north to join the rest of the Maelstrom.", '\nRecruit (Name):', "\nAye, I'm Ardashir. Who's askin'?\nEh? A pleasure. Me name's “Recruit (Name)” and I'm a proud member of the Maelstrom.\nAye, me and him are alike to you and me─brawny, brimming with vim and vigor, afire to defend the realm and sing our battle hymn loud and proud.\nThe stories say I'm a born explorer, but I say I'm an explorer who lives for the land. Ever since the gods guided me here, I've been dreamin' of yer someday comin' to take me under yer wing.\nAh, but listen to me prattle on like an Ishgardian knight! I'll get right on it, I can't wait to see yer face when ye get here!\n...Hells, I'd best get back to my patrol. Might be I'll see ye there, then!\nYer a sight!", '\nRecruit (Name):', "\nAye, I'm Ardashir. Who's askin'?\nEh? A pleasure. My name's “Recruit (Name)” and I'm a proud member of the Maelstrom.

Title: A Blissful Arrival
Dialogue: ['\nBomott:', "\nWelcome to the Quicksand, friend! I am the ferryman, and all my trading is done through these premises.\nEver since the Calamity struck, the sea has risen and fallen with frightening regularity─and Lominsan merchants have been unable to make the trip─so I've been forced to rely more heavily on foreign merchant ships to ferry my goods across the open seas.\nI've no doubt but that the Admiral will be pleased to see the fruits of your efforts, friend─he always is.\nNow, for the journey ahead of us, we first must make the stop at Camp Drybone, where the prisoners are being held.\nThe camp was created as a temporary holding facility, but its residents are not to be taken prisoner indefinitely.\nIf you wish to see your fellow prisoners, you will need to pay your respects at the gates, before departing on your journey back to Ul'dah.", '\nDrybone:', '\nWelcome, sir, to Camp Drybone. If there are any charges that you would deem to be appropriate, we shall be happy to oblige you.\nYou will be pleased to hear that the camp is not only well-appointed, but also relatively inexpensive. While some facilities may be more suitable for hardened criminals, others are designed for the common man.\nLest you worry that the place may be crawling with all manner of fearsome beasts, remember that the Admiral has made it a point to keep the prisoners safe. He would not want anyone dying while he and his family are away.\nYou should also know that the camp is not entirely devoid of danger─there is always a risk that someone will take advantage of the opportunity afforded by the lax security. That is why it is so important that you take care on your journey back.\nI shall return to the ferry and make my arrangements for your return. When you are ready, you may call upon me.', '\nBomott:', "\nWelcome back, friend! Just as I expected.\nYou may be surprised to know that I have another task for you this time! In fact, it's almost the exact same task I gave you a few moons ago!\nYou will recall that I charged you a small fee to transport yourself across the channel.

Dialogue: ['\nCaring Carpenter:', "\nOh, you're the adventurer who saved Mehvan's child! You're an adventurer who gets things done! I was just looking for a reliable hand.\nI had been expecting a delivery from the Holy See, but it never arrived. I'm ever so sorry!\nIt's so important to the people of Radz–at–Han that we deliver these sorts of goods daily. If you could help it, please make your way to the cathedral and deliver a letter to one of the curates. I will be waiting outside!", '\nCaring Carpenter:', "\nI'm ever so sorry! I did everything right, but still the delivery never arrived!\nThis is a big mistake. Could you please explain what happened?\nThe letter said it was bound for Mehvan's House of Splendors. I'll make sure it reaches him! Please hurry, I don't have much time!", '\nHouse of Splendors Curate:', '\nOh, the letter arrived safely! What can I do for you?', '\nHouse of Splendors Curate:', "\nOh, the pleasure's all mine. I'm sure the Carpenter was pleased as peas!\nAhhh, a new face! You must be the adventurer from before.\nI see, I see... You're a hard worker, aren't you?\nI appreciate what you've done for us today. I wish there weren't so many other adventurers who treated us as they should.\nI hope to one day be able to repay your kindness with a cup of tea! Though that dream's a bit far off, I suppose there's always a way."]
