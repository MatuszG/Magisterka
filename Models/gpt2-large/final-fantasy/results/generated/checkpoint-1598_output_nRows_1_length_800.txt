Dialogue: ['\nRyne:', "\nWell met, adventurer. Do you have something for me?", '\nRyne:', "\nOh, thank you so much! I was hoping to see if there was any truth to the rumors.\nA man named Gerolt, you see, has been posting fliers around town. He claims to have been promised a reward by the Skulls for his services.\nHe's a rather interesting character, to be sure. He's got a bit of an obsession with all things ancient. I daresay he's a bit too obsessed, but I can't help thinking he's a bit intriguing.\nAnd I've heard that you are a rather peculiar sort of individual. So, do you think you could speak with him for me?\nPlease, I'm sure he'd be happy to oblige you. The only problem I have is that I've got a rather peculiar request to make of you.\n...What? Why, I'd like you to visit the Skulls and speak with a man named Gundobald.\nYou'll find him standing by the north gate.\nGundobald is a rather peculiar fellow. He's been seen lurking near the north gate of the Temple of the Fist, and seems to be in quite a bind.\nApparently, he's been promised a reward by the Skulls for his services, and he's been rather cross with the whole affair.\nI imagine he's decided to take matters into his own hands and post fliers all over the place. I'm sure he'd appreciate any help he can get.\nIf you should happen to see him, you can tell him I said “thank you for your help,” and that I hope to meet you back at the Temple of the Fist.", '\nGerolt:', "\nGreetings, adventurer.\nGundobald was in a rather foul mood earlier.
