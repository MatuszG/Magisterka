Dialogue: ['\nCeana:', '\nHave you heard? The Eulmoran forces are massing for an assault on Castrum Centri.\nThe House Durendaire knights are ready to meet them. But they are not authorized to take to the field.\nWe must ask you to lend your support. Speak with Ser Marcelain in the barracks. He will explain the situation.', '\nMarcelain:', "\nAh, Forename─good to see you again. I take it you have heard the report.\nCeana has asked me to tell you that the Temple Knights are not authorized to take to the field. As such, they are not equipped to fight at close quarters.\nIn fact, they are ill-equipped to even stand on their own. They are woefully undermanned.\nBut they are not entirely without recourse.\nThey may turn to the relic─the one weapon they have never been able to use in battle.\nBut we will not let them use it.\nThe House Durendaire knights are trained to wield steel. But a dragon's breath burns faster in this metal than in any other.\nIf they are to even lay a finger on that relic, they will be destroyed. I pray you do not have to use it.\nBut do not take my word for it. Doubtless Ser Marcelain will be able to tell you more. Pray speak with him, and find out for yourself."]

Dialogue: ['\nResistance Councilor:', "Greetings, honored member of the Council. I would have you attend a council of our sister organizations.\nAt great personal risk, you are to deliver a petition to our sister organizations.\nBefore you begin, I would like you to take this Azeyma rose oil and a feather to the Allied forces stationed at Castrum Centri.\nYou are to deliver the petitions to the Alliance military forces at Castrum Centri.\nWhen you arrive, there will be a man by the name of Cid Aldynn standing guard. Give him the rose oil and feather, and he will tell you where to go.\nMake your way to Castrum Centri and deliver petitions to Alliance military forces. Cid Aldynn will be watching. Please hurry!", '\nCid Aldynn:', "Welcome, honored guest. My name is Cid Aldynn. I serve at the pleasure of the Resistance Councilor.\nYou wish to deliver a petition to our sister organizations?\nVery well. I will mark the locations on your map.\nPlease hurry─the men guarding the entrance are certain to notice you.\nPlease hurry, before the Alliance forces notice you as well.", '\nPop:', '\nYou sense a hostile presence!', '\nCid Aldynn:', "Ah, you're back. I hope you didn't waste too much energy delivering the petition.\nOur Resistance has a long and proud history. But it is now clear that the time for bickering and squabbling is over. The time for fighting has come.\nYou see, the time for talking has passed. Now it is time for action.\nThe Alliance military forces stationed at Castrum Centri are a part of our fight. They must be made ready for battle.\nThey are being trained to fight, and only through battle can we ensure that they are ready.\nTo ensure that they are, we have established a new military unit, the Allied Land Forces.\nThe Alliance military forces at Castrum Centri are under our command. We will ensure that they are trained and equipped to meet the challenges of our time.\nBut we must not let our enemies take advantage of our unprepared allies. That is why I have asked you to deliver this petition.\nIt is my hope that you will use this opportunity to strengthen your ties with our sister organizations. I look forward to your continued cooperation!"]

Dialogue: ['\nKorille:', '\nGreetings, Forename. I have a task for you.\nYou see, a band of Vanu escaped from captivity in Ok' Zundu. They now roam freely in the northern reaches.\nAs you have no ties to the tribe, I would have you travel to Ok' Zundu and seek out their leaders.\nIf they should surrender themselves peacefully, you will be permitted to take their weapons and armor. If they resist, however, you will be forced to kill them.\nIf they should surrender themselves peacefully, you will be permitted to take their weapons and armor.

The fate of Ok' Zundu rests in your hands.', '\nPop:', '\nYou sense a hostile presence!', '\nKorille:', '\nGood. I trust you did not encounter any resistance.\nNow, the leaders are to be found in Ok' Zundu. Please hurry, before the Zundu retaliate against the Sahagin.\nI trust you are familiar with the situation? Should the Zundu choose to fight, they will be no match for our combined strength.\nIt is not my place to make such a decision, but I ask that you speak with the leaders in person. Make your decision, and inform the others that they must surrender if they wish to live.', '\nKorille:', '\nPlease make your decision, Forename, and inform the others that they must surrender if they wish to live.', '\nAhlduwil:', '\nWe have no choice─we must surrender.', '\nPop:', '\nYou sense a hostile presence!', '\nKorille:', '\nGood. You made the right decision.\nThough we came here to treat with the leaders, it is clear to me now that they have no one to blame but themselves.\nWhile we have made a noble effort to win over the Zundu, the fact remains that the situation remains unchanged.\nThe leaders are no better than the Zundu─the worst of the lot. They have no respect for the other tribes, and will stop at nothing to preserve their own interests.\nTheir reckless actions have cost us naught, but they have kept Ok' Zundu from working together as one.\nTo break this impasse must be the goal of all Ok' Zundu, not just the leaders.\nI do not wish to be defeated─I simply wish to survive.
