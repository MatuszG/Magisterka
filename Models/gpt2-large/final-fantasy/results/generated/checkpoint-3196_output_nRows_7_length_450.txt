Not only did you hear the words of the gods themselves, but you gained an insight into the inner workings of the Amalj'aa.\nBefore we part ways, there is one more task I would ask of you. The task is to slay a certain beast─a dhalmelspith─which is infesting a cave on the northern border of Camp Overlook.\nTo get this beast, you must first weaken it.

This will allow us to amplify the aether further.\nThe blessed instrument we will craft uses crystals of the same type used to create the armor─gold for the base, silver for the accoutrements.\nThe crystals are broken at the same place, but in a different order.
