Dialogue: ['\nNedrickironheart:', "\nThe price of Nedrick's freedom was dear, but the price was worth it.\nThe Ixal have been moving into Coerthas in a lasting way, and their presence is a constant source of trouble for the settlement.\nTheir recent incursions into the Twelveswood have been particularly troubling. The House Durendaire knights must be called in to bolster the defenses.\nBut I fear that will not be easy. Our garrison of only 7,000 men is hardly a match for the Ixal's many resources─which means that even should we draw them off our lands, victory is likely to be short-lived.\nIf we are to survive, we must needs turn to the allies of Ronka, the Scions, and the Horde. And I am certain that the three parties will consider the situation dire indeed.:", '\nNedrickironheart:', '\nSo it is to the Dravanian hinterlands that we must go. I trust that you have heard the rumors—the land is fraught with peril.\nThe Dravanians would have us fight only against their interests─not that there is any real threat to our freedom.']

Not heretics, then? But of course! The Syndicate would not settle for anything less than their full quota.\nAnd what exactly is their quota? I know not, but I gather that it is a measure of their faith in the efficacy of their craft. In other words, it is a price they are prepared to pay.\nNow, you may be wondering just why the Syndicate would make such a deal with an unbeliever. The simple answer is that they cannot very well abandon their weapons─they must needs be returned to the people of Ishgard.\nBut what of the people of Whitebrim Front? Why would they sell to a heretic? The answer, I think, has something to do with the weapons themselves.\nA weapon may be useful to an unbeliever, but it is useless to a heretic.\nThe Garleans' surplus is to be sold to─\nHm?
