Dialogue: ['\nDadanen:', "\nForename, I am pleased to inform you that the Ironworks has agreed to purchase the entirety of the former Camp Dragonhead's armory.\nIf you're familiar with the armory, you've likely noticed the giant hammer protruding from its base. As the camp's defense mechanism, the hammer was crucial to its continued operation.\nHowever, in the wake of the Calamity─and in order to preserve its armory's functionality─the Ironworks has worked tirelessly to perfect a new design.\nThe new design is said to be more compact, lighter, and─most importantly─more powerful than the old one.\nIt is hoped that the new hammer will be more effective against sin eaters and their minions.\nThe hammer is currently in the hands of our craftsmen, and I expect them to begin testing the new design soon.\nWhile I cannot comment on whether or not the purchase will result in additional work for us, I can say with certainty that we will have more to offer our customers in the future.\nI would be remiss if I neglected to mention what has brought you here.\nThe hammer you have brought me is the culmination of years of dedication and sacrifice.\nIt was my dream to create an armory that would honor its former defenders, and I believe I have achieved it.\nI am proud to have played a small role in its creation─I would be remiss if I neglected to thank you for your assistance.\nRest assured that our future work will focus on strengthening our relationships with our merchants and our nation.\nThank you again for your continued support, Forename."]
