Dialogue: ['\nY'shtola:', "\nThe name's Y'shtola. The young man's been the most influential scholar of our age for a time, and a few years ago he made a bold move that would have made him an instant success.\nThat was to take a trip to the moon and visit the most remote and unexplored locations. He thought it would be a challenge, but I can assure you he was not exaggerating.\nHe said he'd need three men to do the job, but I'm certain he would have been more generous if he had known we'd have no one to turn to.\nInstead he asked for three of the most skilled beekeepers in the world. I doubt he knew it would be such a daunting task, but I would have been happy to help.\nI told him I'd be willing to help, but I feared he would never listen. I told him I'd be happy to help, but I feared he would never listen.\nWe came here from Ishgard, you see, and it's our job to protect the hive. To protect the hive, you need to protect the hive.\nThat's why I went looking for one of the most skilled beekeepers in the world, and I found him. It took me some time to realize he was speaking from the perspective of a young beekeeper, but I soon found that I could share some of his experiences.\nHe told me much of his journey to the moon, and how he'd become one of the finest beekeepers in the world.\nI was so taken with his story that I felt I could make the same journey. I thought it would be a worthwhile journey.\nBut then I met Y'shtola. I thought he would be the one to help me, but he would never listen.\nSo I asked him to help me. I asked him to help me.\nI couldn't say no to him. I had to hear his story.\nI'm glad you helped me. I hope you can help Y'shtola as well."]
