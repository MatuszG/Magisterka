There's something I need to tell you.\nA long time ago, I was living in Ul'dah, doing research on the aether. There, I stumbled upon a theory that, when exposed to certain types of aether, the people of the world would undergo drastic changes.\nThough I knew it was absurd, I could not stop thinking it. So I went ahead and created a simulated environment in which to test my theory.\nI named it the “bubble” of Arvide. All of the inhabitants of the world were placed within it, and the aether was exposed at regular intervals.\nAfter a while, I began to wonder if, when the aether was released, the people of Arvide would spontaneously combust.\nAfter much deliberation, I decided to test it by having the residents of Ul'dah race against one another in the race to see who would emerge victorious.\nThe winner would receive a beautiful crystal from me. Of course, I knew it would be difficult to keep the participants of the race confined to the bubble for so long, so I made it so that they could compete against one another in other areas as well.\nThe winners have been placed in three separate groups─the winners in each group will be receiving their respective crystals from me.\nYou are all familiar with the “bubble” concept, yes? If you do not, allow me to explain.\nSimply put, the more aether a person breathes in, the more beautiful the crystal they will receive.
