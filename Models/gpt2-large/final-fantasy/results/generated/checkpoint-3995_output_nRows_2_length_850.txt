Dialogue: ['\nTatafu:', "\nY-You! Yes, you! You are a man from above and one who appears to be a savior of sorts for our people. Truly, you are a breath of fresh air in these troubled times!\nYou see, our merchants from the Crystarium were recently approached by a man who offered them vast fortunes to procure wares that would satisfy even the most discerning paladin. Upon demanding the details of the transaction, the man grew increasingly irate and began shouting at the men. When one of the men attempted to restrain the man, he drew a hidden blade and lashed out.\nThankfully, one of the customers who was present at the time was able to subdue the aggressor and arrest the man. However, that was not to be the end of the trouble this time.\nThe suspect is a man who goes by the name of “Kumozi.” If you are able to ascertain his whereabouts, please contact him and let him know you have been contacted. I would also ask that you search the area around the station for him.", '\nKumozi:', '\nYes? Yes, I am the one who was attacked. Yes, I was approached by a man who seemed to be in his mid-teens. He asked many questions about the sale of wares and eventually asked for large amounts of gil to be delivered in exchange for items.\nI agreed to meet him in the Beloved Host if he promised not to assault anyone. However, I then received word that he had murdered one of our fellow merchants. That is when I decided to leave the area and notify the authorities.\nHowever, there is a chance that you may encounter the man who attacked me. If you do, please do not hesitate to come to my aid.\nIf you are able to locate the man who attacked me, please do not hesitate to come to his aid. I would also ask that you search the area around the Beloved Host for him.', '\nTatafu:', '\nKumozi was attacked in the Beloved Host, yet he escaped? That is a story that will not be told in polite company!\nIt is true that the man who attacked me was in his mid-teens. However, he is not the same deranged madman that attacked the merchants. No, this time he appears to be a rather ordinary young man who appears to be in his late forties...though that would put him in his late forties when you consider the ages of the alleged victims.\nIt seems likely that the same young man who attacked the merchants is responsible for the two other attacks. I would have you continue your investigation and inform the authorities if you find the same suspect.', '\nKumozi:', '\nPlease, you must not harm me. I did not do anything wrong.', '\nTatafu:', "\nThank you, adventurer. You are as good a person as I have ever had the pleasure of knowing!\nThe suspect in the first attack is an Elezen, yet this time he is not the one who attacked the merchants. No, this time he is an Elezen who is in his thirties. It would not surprise me if the man who attacked the merchants is the same one who approached the Elezen in the first place.\nIt would not surprise me if the man who attacked the merchants is the same one who approached the Elezen in the first place.

Dialogue: ['\nAethelmaer:', "\nWell come, Forename. I trust you've been keeping busy of late. I've been pondering my plan to capture an imperial agent.\nI've recruited adventurers to help us with the endeavor, but one of them has yet to return. The search is ongoing, but I fear he may have taken some other unsuspecting traveler on a wild adventure.\nThat's where you come in. I need you to speak with this fellow and see if there is any truth to his statement that he is being held in an imperial cell.\nIf he is telling the truth, I would be most grateful if you would seek him out and confirm it.", '\nImperial Citizen:', "\nWho goes there?

That is good to hear.\nI will send word to the Wailers at once.\nI should not be surprised if this fellow is held in the cell for longer than a day or two. It would not surprise me in the least to learn that he is being interrogated.\nI will keep the search underway and have my men keep watch for any Imperial agents we should come across. We shall see if this fellow is indeed being held in an imperial cell, then."]
