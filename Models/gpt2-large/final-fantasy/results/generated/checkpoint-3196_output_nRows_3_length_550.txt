Dialogue: ['\nZlatan:', "\nAccording to Regana's report, the Alliance leaders had an audience with Haurchefant. At the request of the Serpents' representative, the Alliance leaders asked Haurchefant to supply them with weapons and armor in exchange for their support.\nHaurchefant agreed, and the leaders subsequently issued an edict requiring all members of the Alliance to fulfill this obligation.\nUpon learning of this development, the leaders immediately sought to redirect the Alliance's resources toward their own defense. To this end, they dispatched representatives to the House of Splendors to discuss the matter.\nAfter deliberation, the leaders elected to proceed with the exchange only after reviewing the potential benefits to be gained from doing so.\nThe House of Splendors representatives explained the situation to Haurchefant, and he agreed to allow the exchange.\nAs you are aware, the House of Splendors is home to a number of our nation's elite mercenaries. These men and women are employed in various capacities across a variety of fields.\nIn light of these various roles, we thought it would be beneficial to develop a more diverse armory of weapons and armor.\nThe House of Splendors representatives further explained the situation to Haurchefant, and he agreed to allow the exchange.\nI have been charged with facilitating the exchange and will continue to do so in cooperation with both the Alliance leaders and the House of Splendors representatives.\nShould you have a change in plans, I will be sure to let you know.\nSincerely,\nZlatan."]

Forename, this is Shihoji, an associate of mine.\nAnd I'm told he has an air of competence as a researcher, which is quite different from the blathering babble he sometimes spouts on the campaign trail. What's that? You're an expert in your field, are you not?\nOh, thank you! I am in need of a performance appraisal, and I would be ever so grateful if you could deliver it to my colleague here in Kugane.\nI'm Shihoji, by the way. Enjoy your visit, and tell your fellow researchers how much you admire them.", '\nWataru:', "\nI've heard about Shihoji, and I'm fascinated by his research.

Here is the appraisal for Wataru.', '\nOtakubo:', "\nYes, I agree with everything he said!

Dialogue: ['\nGibrillont:', "\n'Twas on the eve of the Battle of Carteneau, nigh on fifteen years ago. The Allied forces discovered a previously unknown deposit of magitek weaponry at the bottom of the crater.\nIt was at this very moment that our nation's greatest weaponsmith was commissioned to create an entirely new type of weapon─the magitek artillery.\nAfter much deliberation, he finally decided to pursue this promising new field of research in earnest. His ultimate objective was to develop a weapon that could destroy all forms of enemy weaponry, not just those based on crystal.\nAfter much deliberation, he finally decided to pursue this promising new field of research in earnest. His ultimate objective was to develop a weapon that could destroy all forms of enemy weaponry, not just those based on crystal.\nUnfortunately, a number of factors conspired to keep him from achieving his goals. The most troublesome was the fact that the weapon's development was hampered by a number of factors.\nBut one man's hindrance is no excuse for another's gorging. I have a solution─a solution that will free us from our torment!\nI need for you to travel to East End and retrieve three prototype magitek cannons. You will find them in the ruins to the northeast. Bring them back here so that I can properly evaluate the performance of my new weapon.\nThis is an experimental weapon. It will be wholly ineffective against most forms of fiend weaponry. Do not expect it to be of much help against the common soldier, however.\nI will give you three of the cannons, but you will have to give me more of the same if you wish to try your hand at combat. I will not give you more than I need.\nPlease return to me once you have the cannons.", '\nGibrillont:', '\nHave you brought me my experimental weapon?', '\nGibrillont:', "\nOh, this is much more than I bargained for! I will have to try it out for myself soon, but thank you so much for procuring the cannons.\n'Tis an honor to finally put my dream into fruition. Thank you also for procuring the prototype.\nThis is a work of art, truly a work of genius. The techniques used to develop this weapon are so advanced that they even inspired me to pursue new possibilities in my research.\nI will continue to work on this in secret, but you can be sure that I will share with you my discoveries as soon as they are complete

You are a man who has the heart of a lancer, and in return I trust you will understand my pain.\nI lost my husband, and in his will he wrote that he would be watching us from the skies. I wanted to follow in his footsteps, and so we bought an kettled and set forth to hunt the bakufu.\nOur destination was the House of the Fierce, where our son would receive his axe. When we arrived, it was filled with our friends, and we were treated to a display of the clan's martial prowess.\nBut just as we set out, our paths were cut off by a group of kettled. I was able to escape, but not my husband.\nThe House of the Fierce is said to be home to those who have fallen in the line of duty. It is said that those who have served honorably are blessed by the kami themselves, and that those who die in battle are given a place within the House of the Fierce to be honored.\nTo receive an instrument from our fallen comrades would mean a great deal to us. It would mean they are now at peace. Please, take it back to us!', '\nMozu:', '\nMy beloved, you are a lancer in your own right now.
