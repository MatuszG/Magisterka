The House Durendaire has a surplus of coin, and they're willing to pay you for it.\nIf you've heard of coin auctions, you know that they're sort of like the Scions of the Seventh Dawn, except they don't have any members.

Dialogue: ['\nGildon:', '\nYou there, adventurer. My name is Gildon, and I am in charge of overseeing the restoration of the Temple of the Fist.\nThe temple, you see, was originally built to serve as a place of prayer and meditation for monks and other temple-affiliated practitioners. But as the fighting began to escalate in the wake of the Calamity, it quickly became a place of death and destruction.\nAnd now, all that remains of that once-proud temple is a handful of rubble.\nIt is for this reason that we have decided to reopen the doors to the Fist and reopen its corridors. I would be most grateful if you could make your way there and begin clearing the rubble.\nMy thanks, sir. I am sure you will find the task quite taxing, but I am certain that it will be worth your while.', '\nGildon:', '\nYou have returned, and with good tidings? Ah, my apologies. The Temple of the Fist is not known for its hospitality, and we do not have much to offer other than these empty words.']
