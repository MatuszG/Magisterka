Dialogue: ['\nViraban:', "\nAh, a traveler comes bearing gifts. Would you be willing to accept this as a token of my gratitude?\nI had a son, and through his childhood and into his manhood, I never failed to find joy in his company. That joy was to last a lifetime, for my boy was possessed of a tender heart and resplendent spirit.\nYet the gods alone know what would have become of him had he lived. He was a brilliant scholar, and one of the finest alchemists of our time. Perhaps he would still be alive today, contributing to our knowledge of alchemy.\nRegardless, I would like to give him this as a token of my gratitude. I will see that it reaches him, and that he continues to cherish the company of those who share his dream.\nI am pleased to see that you are already acquainted with this custom. Alchemists of your caliber are few and far between, and it is ever a pleasure to meet one of your kind.\nI pray that you will continue to honor my boy's memory, and that he will continue to be a source of inspiration
