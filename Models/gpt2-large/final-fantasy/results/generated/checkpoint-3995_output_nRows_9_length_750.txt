It's been all of five minutes and you've already had your fill of assisting the Holy See!\nYou see, the archbishop has been waiting for you outside the doors of the Congregation. He's been quite agitated of late, and when Father Iliud arrived moments ago, well... There was no mistaking the fire in his eyes.\nAnyway, you see, he's been urging me to hurry─to deliver an urgent message to the Holy See. It concerns the chirurgeons of Elpis.\nThey've been dispatched to the Crystarium to treat the wounded, but they've yet to arrive. I would have you and the archbishop join them there at once!\nThe Holy See would be much in your debt if you could deliver this message to Alphinaud at the Crystarium.

Fufucha sent word that the archbishop had arrived. I suppose all that waiting wouldn't have been so bad if he'd been...\nAnyway, I must be going. It's only a short trip to the Crystarium, but I wanted to make sure Fufucha was aware of the situation.\nI know Fufucha has her pride, but she's right─these men are in desperate need. Iliud must be assured that his men are safe.", '\nFufucha:', 'I was only recently informed of the situation, but I imagine Father Iliud and Alphinaud are already aware.\nWell, all that remains is to deliver the message.

Dialogue: ['\nSeverian:', '\nWelcome, sir. I take it by your imposing build that you are Severian of the House Dzemael. A pleasure. You are come at a good time. I have a task that could use your assistance.\nI was told today that a merchant would be arriving in Reunion to conduct a business transaction. That would be a fine opportunity to strengthen the House's reputation.\nHowever, I have not been given the name of the merchant. It is common knowledge that he is a heretic who preaches the heresy of heresy. The man has been sighted at the Coliseum, you see, and was compelled to leave the city.\nThe House Dzemael would not allow him to enter Reunion if he were a heretic. They would not allow him to enter Reunion if he were a heretic.\nBut I am a heretic. I do not care to be a heretic. I do not care to offend anyone. And I certainly do not wish to offend you.\nSeverian has been named by the Holy See to conduct business in Reunion. But he cannot enter Reunion if he is a heretic.\nThe Holy See has decreed that only 'purely pious individuals may engage in commercial activity in Reunion. It is a very strict regulation.\nSeverian is a man of great repute, and I do not doubt that he would be well received by the citizens of Reunion. But he must first prove to them that he is a true and pure heretic.\nI will ask that you visit him in Reunion and conduct yourself in a manner worthy of a heretic. Do not hesitate to defend yourself should the opportunity present itself.', '\nSeverian:', '\nWelcome back. You have my thanks.\nA merchant, a heretic, and a city all belong to the House Dzemael. It is our duty to protect and defend the people of Reunion.\nThere is only one law for a heretic: death.\nI was born a heretic. I was not chosen to be a heretic. I was chosen to be a heretic.\nI knew I was a heretic when I was little. I knew I was a heretic when I was young.\nI knew I was a heretic when I was old. I knew I was a heretic when I was dying.\nI did not choose to become a heretic. I was born a heretic. And I will remain a heretic.\nNow that I am a heretic, I will go and speak with the merchant. I will go and speak with him and show him my hatred. That is all I can do for now.\nThank you. I hope you do not think me a bad, cold-hearted heretic. I am a good, pure, and honest heretic. And I hope that you, my friend, will hold me in high esteem.\nSeverian has been named by the Holy See to conduct business in Reunion. But he cannot enter Reunion if he is a heretic.']

We won't be serving up fine wine, and there will be no dancing. No, the aim is to present an in-depth look at the creation of the Ultima Weapon, from the moment its secrets were revealed to the final product.\nAnd, by the time you're done gazing at this display, you'll have a better understanding of just how much work it took to bring you here.

Its name is “psom salt” and it is said to have soothing properties.\nI had a mind to perform an investigation myself, but Lord Haurchefant said he would require a representative of my caliber. I suppose it only makes sense that he would have me travel to his headquarters.\nAnd I should mention that it has been some time since I last saw him.

Dialogue: ['\nDadanen:', "\nWelcome, ally of Ronka. I am glad you came.\nYou wish to help us recover our fallen comrades, I know. This is a difficult task, and one made more difficult by the fact that they were taken during the most violent fighting of our time.\nAnd so I would ask something of you. I would ask you to travel to Camp Broken Glass and meet with our leaders.\nSpeak with Commander Hext to learn of our plans. I have instructed my subordinates to give you a brief tour of the place before you depart.", '\nHext:', "\nWhat brings an ally of Ronka to this godsforsaken place? You're looking for trouble, I take it.\nYou're here on the wrong floor, friend. We're not here to discuss your past sins. You've dishonored the name of the Scions. The name's of no use to us.\nNow get out of here. This isn't a place for the faint of heart.\nYou may leave the wretch that you find here to the care of our meditators. You may not return alive.", '\nDadanen:', '\nYou have my thanks, ally of Ronka.\nThe leaders will be waiting.\nOur casualties were all young. Some still remain unaccounted for. The investigation is ongoing, and I fear some may never be found.']

Dialogue: ['\nZlatan:', "\nAccording to Master Gerolt, the Eorzean Alliance has established a new airship route known as the “blue route.” It follows the coastline of southern Thanalan and links the Blue Window with the White.\nHowever, while the House of Splendors has made considerable progress in its development of these airships, there is still much to be done before they can be sent into service.\nI would ask you to assist our airship pilots in completing a final test flight. The trial flight will be conducted from the House of Splendors' airship landing in southern Thanalan.\nPlease make your way to the airship landing and aid our airship pilots in completing their final test flight. The trial flight will be conducted from the House of Splendors' airship landing.", '\nZlatan:', '\nThank you for your cooperation. The House of Splendors welcomes your assistance in furthering the development of our airship program.', '\nAlisaie:', '\nSo it is done then, Forename.\nI was beginning to worry something had happened.\nBut now that you mention it, it does seem like Master Gerolt was not exaggerating when he spoke of the size of these new airships.\nIf anything, I think you might be more right than Gerolt.\nIf ever there was a need for a larger airship, I think this would be it.', '\nGerolt:', "\nIt's bigger than I imagined! And slighter too.\nCompared to the old models, this one's design's simplicity's been improved for the better.\nAnd it looks good, too─more like a ship than an airship, I suppose.\nIf all goes to plan, we should be able to launch these new models into service before long.\nThough I suppose there's only so much an airship can do for you─you'll be taking your first flight as a test pilot soon enough, won't you?", '\nZlatan:', '\nYou are returned from your mission a moment ago. What news?\nIt seems your test flight was a success.\nAnd you are not alone in your excitement at the prospect of the new models. Forename, Alisaie, I can sense your excitement, and so too can the House of Splendors.', '\nGerolt:', "\nWhat was it you two had to discuss?\nThe details of the mission, you say? I've heard enough about that already. Tell me, have you ever heard of the “blue route?”", '\nAlisaie:', "\nIt's the name of the new airship route the House of Splendors is establishing. The pilots of the White and Blue Window are working day and night to finalize the specifications for these new airships.\nOnce their design is complete, they will be ready to fly.\nA number of our facilities have been dedicated to the development of these models, including the Test Chamber and the Scaffold.\nBut even with such dedicated facilities, there are always unexpected problems that require solving.\nIn fact, your recent flight was no exception.\nThe House of Splendors would not be able to develop new models if not for the assistance of our pilots, you see, and your timely assistance in solving their problems will be greatly appreciated.\nSo while your contribution
