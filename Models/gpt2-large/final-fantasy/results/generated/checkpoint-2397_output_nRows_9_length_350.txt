You have served the Grand Company admirably─though perhaps not so admirably as you might have hoped.\nYou see, the Order of the Twin Adder has been investigating the ruins west of the Observatorium since last we heard. We suspect that they are the burial grounds of Pharos Sirius, the first and foremost of the Dalriada's bastions of learning.\nI would ask you to take part in a reconnaissance mission to the west─the so-called “Aetherial Wall”─that may eventually lead us to Pharos Sirius itself.\nYou need not speak with me again until the mission is complete, or I will personally see you removed from my sight.\nI shall await your arrival at the Observatorium. Pray speak with me again should you wish to proceed.', '\nBraya:', '\nYou are returned! And I trust that you have learned a valuable lesson from your mission.\nAs you know, we believe that the walls of Pharos Sirius were permeated with aether. This permeation was sufficient to ensure that any and all entities within the vicinity─be they souls, beasts, or simply the elements─were rendered unable to act upon the land.\nThis is why we are pursuing the elementals that may have resided within the ruins. If they are to be found, we shall raze them to the ground and restore the Observatorium
