Dialogue: ['\nSevrin:', "\nYou there. I'm Sevrin, a researcher at the Thalassai.\nI've been tasked with studying the life cycle of a variety of arthropods, but I'm also tasked with creating a pesticide that will be as effective as possible.\nA number of my colleagues are already on the job, and I was hoping you might lend your aid in the creation of this new pesticide.\nI need you to collect a sample of the pesticide from the rock near Mount Gulg─about four to six sprigs should suffice.\nPlease make sure not to damage the rock. If the pesticide is applied properly, you should be able to spray the area from cover.", '\nSevrin:', '\nPlease bring me a sample of the pesticide from the rock near Mount Gulg.

It's such a relief to know that even if we don't have the means to spray from cover, we can still keep the wood healthy and sound.\nThanks to you, I'm almost certain that my research will proceed as planned. Please accept this as thanks for your help.']
