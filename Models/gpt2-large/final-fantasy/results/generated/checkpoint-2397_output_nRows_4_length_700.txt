It is said that a master musician once gifted an instrument to a child of his choosing, and that it was passed down through generations.\nMy master, however, did not intend for the child to use it for years to come.

If I may, I would ask that you deliver it to my son, who is just now starting his studies at the Ruby Price.\nHe is currently training under the guidance of Master Garlond. I have already sent word to him, but he is yet to return. Please, would you go and see if he is all right?\nThank you, Master Surname. You are a true friend.\nI could tell you more, but the boy is likely still overworking himself. Please hurry, before he overhears you.', '\nGarlond:', '\nAh, Forename─I trust you have seen to the boy? I am pleased to say that he is now well versed in the history of the instrument, as well as the techniques by which it was crafted.\nIt is no exaggeration to say that my pupils are enraptured by your performance─they have never been able to match your skill with a blade.\nIt is thanks to you, however, that we are able to continue this tradition of teaching our students the history of our art.\nI am proud to say that in addition to his studies, my pupil is also working on a new piece. I believe it will be a fitting tribute to your outstanding performance.']
