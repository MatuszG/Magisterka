Dialogue: ['\nSisipu:', "\nAh, Forename─the name's Sisipu─and welcome to the Thaliak.\nMy name's Sisipu, and I'm a researcher here at the Thaliak, if you can believe that.\nAs you may have heard, we've been working to recreate the conditions that existed in ancient times. One of those was the lush vegetation known as the “Valley of the Four Arms” that covered much of Central Thanalan.\nSome of the most remarkable finds we've made so far are the exquisite ceruleum samples, which we've been able to extract from ancient bones and other ancient relics.\nWith the help of ancient organisms, we've been able to recreate the conditions that existed in ancient times. One of those was the lush vegetation known as the “Valley of the Four Arms” that covered much of Central Thanalan.\nSome of the most remarkable finds we've made so far are the exquisite ceruleum samples, which we've been able to extract from ancient bones and other ancient relics.\nIt's been quite an adventure, I must say. Had I not been blessed with an extraordinary specimen to bring, I would have been forced to settle for a mediocre one.\nI must say that my work here has been far from easy. We have had to contend with creatures that are more fearsome than any we have ever encountered, and the sheer quantity of samples we have been asked to collect has been quite a burden.\nBut I am proud to say that I have made discoveries that I would not have been able to make had I been alone. My colleagues and I owe you a great debt of gratitude.\nYou have my sincerest gratitude, Forename. Thank you for everything you've done.\nIt is no exaggeration to say that the Thaliak has saved my life. Had I been forced to quit my research, I would have been buried beneath a mountain of cobble.\n...Oh, that's enough about me. Thank you for your continued support, and for lending an ear to my research. I hope that you'll continue to support the Thaliak in the future.\n"]
