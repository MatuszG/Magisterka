Dialogue: ['\nLaniaitte:', 'Ah, Forename! I have received word from Ser Leaudaste of your success. Truly, you are a born performer. I am told your timing is impeccable.\nBut I must ask, why did the Elder Seedseer entrust the creation of this instrument to you?\nI understand the importance of ensuring the longevity of our creations, but to allow others to use it in their performances?

I only wish to give you an opportunity to make a contribution.\nI would be most grateful were you to deliver this hunting log to Sister Eluned, along with this request: “Please deliver this hunting log to Sister Eluned in Gridania. “This is a record of all the hunts the Elder Seedseer has approved for the use of our instrument. Each entry contains the name of a guild member that has been approved to use it in their performances.\nPlease be aware

Dialogue: ['\nSeverian:', "\nYou look to have a fine arm to handle such a weapon. I am sure you must have heard the tales, but did you not hear the one about a man who wielded a blowpipe as well?\nAh, yes. That was my inspiration for the blowpipe. I had thought to make a bow and arrow and sell them as a collectable, but it seems collectors are not so willing to part with their wares.\nAs a fellow artisan, I understand your dilemma.
