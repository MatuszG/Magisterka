If you have a moment, I would ask a favor of you.\nI've been looking around the markets and I've run into a bazaar wares called “respite” which seems to be selling quite well. I would be grateful if you could take a few of the pieces back to me.\nIf you'd be willing to take a few pieces of respite from the bazaar, I ask that you place the pieces in my hands so that I might determine their value.\nThe pieces I would be most grateful for are the yellow and orange pieces. Place as many of the pieces as you can in my hands and I will evaluate their worth.\nLet me know when you have placed the pieces in my hands and I will be happy to pay you.\nI can't say I have seen the pieces in person, but from what I have heard, the pieces appear to be of good quality.", '\nSylgran:', "Ah, you've returned. I can see now that the pieces you've brought me are of a high quality.\nI should not be surprised that the bazaar is thriving. There are many reasons why people choose to purchase wares here, but a lack of competition is not one of them.\nWhen I was a child, the Garleans stormed our village and stole all of our belongings. They spared us the devastation that would have surely occurred had they succeeded in looting our stores.\nWhile I was able to salvage what I could of my possessions, I was

Title: A Breath of Respite
Dialogue: ['\nAlisaie:', "\nAs Alphinaud mentioned, the matter of the missing archbishop has been brought before the Holy See.\nIt is for the Holy See that we must obtain the writ of summoning, which was issued by the Grand Companies of Ul'dah and Ishgard.\nThe archbishop's personal envoy, however, was not included in the batch sent to the capital. Instead, we have been asked to procure a representative of the Azure Dragoon's company from Whitebrim Front, a company of dragoons employed by House Durendaire.\nThe representative is a dragoon of considerable stature, though not quite six feet tall. He is stationed at the Gates of Judgement in central Thanalan, and is to be afforded every courtesy and courtesyarium.\nSo you see, we have been requested to travel to Whitebrim Front, and to do so we must needs enlist the services of a dragoon of House Durendaire.\nIf you would be so kind as to escort our envoy to the gates of Judgement, you may do so from the Gates of Judgement in central Thanalan. We would be most grateful for any assistance you can provide.\nOur dragoons are stationed at the gates of Judgement in central Thanalan. You will need to escort our envoy to the gates of Judgement, from the Gates of Judgement in central Thanalan.", '\nAlisaie:', "\nOur envoy will arrive in just a moment. It wouldn't do to keep the man waiting.\nIt has been far too long, Forename.\

Dialogue: ['\nMarielle:', '\nWelcome back, Forename. Your sister was so worried about you─so concerned, in fact, that she nearly pulled you aside for a talk.\nOf course, being the forgiving and generous soul that she is, I suppose she couldn't help but worry... But worry you not─I have a task that must be done.\nI would have you visit my sister in the Acorn Orchard. There, you will be able to speak with her in her own home.\nWhen you arrive, I would ask that you pay your respects with a bouquet of Nymeia lilies. Off you go now, Forename.', '\nMarielle:', '\nMy sister will be waiting for you at the Acorn Orchard. Pray do her proud, Forename.', '\nMarielle:', "\nWelcome back, Forename. You've spoken with her before.\nA little bird told me that my sister had been moved to the Crystarium. A place of deep reflection, where she may meditate on the deaths of her kin.\nI am told this place was once home to those who died while attempting to rescue the Dravanians from the Garleans' hold on Ishgard.\nPerhaps you are familiar with the “Respite,” a place of quiet sanctuary where Dravanians and other brave souls from across the realm may gather to mourn the fallen. I daresay my sister would be glad to have you visit.\nOf course, I wouldn't be much of an sister if

Dialogue: ['\nRespitekeeper:', "\nGreetings, sir. You're an adventurer, yes? I'm sure you're well aware of that. If not, you've no doubt heard of the Crystarium, the starry abode of Eorzea's patron deity, Hraesvelgr.\nIn recent years, though, visitors have been few and far between, likely due to the rising threat of...the Ixal. The place has been without a patron since the death of Eorzea's first and only, long ago.\nAt any rate, it's my job to find a suitable replacement for the departed. And I am quite certain that my search would be aided by an adventurer of your ability, if you would agree to accompany me.", '\nRespitekeeper:', "\nI would be most grateful if you would search the Crystarium for a suitable patron deity. In the meantime, I ask that you pay a visit to Vira Nilya, the residence of the deceased's family.", '\nVira Nilya:', "\nYou're looking for the patron deity? Then you've come to the right place. The old man was a dear friend and a mentor to many here, so it's only fitting that he be honored in some way.\nI'm not certain, but I've heard that the old man was often seen wearing a gold bandana emblazoned with a golden wreath. It's said that he would often sit and talk with his students after he finished his work.\nI can only assume that his favorite food was the grillable
