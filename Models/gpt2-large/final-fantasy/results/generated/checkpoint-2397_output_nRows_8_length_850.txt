Not only have you helped me feed myself for today, you've played an important part in the continued survival of the Shroud.\nI hope the day I set foot in that hamlet comes soon.

If you're not careful, you could be faced with a messy end of the world."]

Dialogue: ['\nCid:', "So, are we ready to begin work on the instrument?\nBy Nald, I mean you.\nWe'll begin with a small patch here, but it's a good idea to get acquainted with the basics first.\nLet's begin by taking a look at the wood's history.\nThe wood you'll be working with is alder, alder, and poplar─all of the same species, naturally. The wood has a special relationship with the element, and thus the element's aether.\nNow, the most obvious way to acquire the necessary quantity of aether is to draw it from the earth─and, conversely, the most obvious way to acquire aether is to create it.\nAnd so the wood you'll be working with is alder.

You probably assumed it was some sort of maple, a common wood used in bows and other weapons. That was about the time I learned that the wood was in fact a relic of an ancient civilization.\nThat was about the time I learned that the wood was in fact a relic of an ancient civilization.\nAnyway, enough history. The good news is you're well acquainted with the basics now, so let's get to work.\nBefore we begin, though, I want to make sure you're comfortable with the tools we'll be using. Don't worry─we'll be using the same ones you're using now, so you'll need to change nothing about them.\nNow, while you're waiting for us to finish, I want you to take these two lamps─one for the west and one for the east.\nGo ahead and light both of them.\nWhen you're finished, come back and let me know. Good luck!", '\nPop:', '\nYou sense a hostile presence!', '\nCid:', "Good, you're back. The lamps you brought back were nice, but I'd rather not have a fire right now.\nI'll go ahead and light the west one while you light the east one.\nWhen you're finished, come back and let me know. Good luck!", '\nCid:', "So, you're both finished, and that's a relief. I hope we can use the lamps to its fullest potential."]

I awoke to find that my suit of magitek had spontaneously gone into overdrive, and I was flung from my bed and into the streets of Eulmore!\nI was lucky to escape with my life, but I could not escape the shame of my actions. I know I should have never allowed myself to be drawn into the conflict that led to my friend's injury.\nThat guilt weighs heavily on my heart, and I've struggled to find a way to overcome it. But thanks to you, I've found one. I hope you'll continue to use your aether to your advantage in the future.\nNow, I'd like you to have this. It's nothing extraordinary, but it's a token of my thanks for your help.\n"]

So good of you to come!\nWe've had a poor start to the talks, but we've made steady headway.\nThere is one last piece of the jigsaw that still needs to be put together─and that is the beastman.\nThat's the primal, you see, and its role in the conflict.\nAs I said before, we've established a rapport with the beastmen, but the Ixal sense that we're no longer in the dark.\nTheir sense of reality has grown dim, however, and they perceive our presence to be an invasion.\nIf the talks continue, it will come to light that they've been feeding off the energy of the forest for quite some time.\nThat would be a terrible start to a peace agreement, but we've managed somehow.\nAnd that is all I can tell you about the negotiations. You need only know that I will be on hand to provide support should the talks continue."]
