In the process of gathering them, they've transformed into something that's both tough and sensitive.\nYou see, for all their heinous crimes, the gedan are incredibly valuable to us. If they were to be exterminated, their population would be significantly reduced, which would be a great boon to the forest.\nIn exchange for the gedan, you would be getting a certain amount of valuable lumber, which would be a great help to the forest.
