Perhaps you have heard, but I am now tasked with overseeing the construction of an all-new music box.\nTopped with a pair of crystal choral instruments, it will serve as a place of worship for the Night's Blessed, blessed and righteous.\nIn my opinion, a fine choral instrument should not only provide rich, vibrant sound, but also be capable of moving the heart─or at least, that is the claim I make.\nBut I need not convince you of that. I require your help in acquiring the necessary materials.\nSpecifically, what I require are pieces of bone, round horn, and crystal. Once you have these, pray bring them to me.\nYou will find the items in a locked chest in the Acorn Orchard. It is not the safest of places, so do take care
