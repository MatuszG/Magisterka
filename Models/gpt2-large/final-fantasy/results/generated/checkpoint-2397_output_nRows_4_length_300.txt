How was it?\n...I'm afraid I'm still a little ways off from completing my training, but I'm so glad you were able to help me!\nI was about to head out to meet my aunt when I heard a buzzing from the nearby woods.

Dialogue: ['\nBujeg:', "\nAh, good to see you again, Forename.\nI was beginning to worry that my friend had left you for dead in the wilds.

Dialogue: ['\nDour Dwarf:', "Greetings, sir. I presume you are here to visit the dwarven settlement of Thal's Respite? If so, I would ask you a question, if I may. You see, our settlement─and by extension our entire settlement─is nestled in the shadow of the massive Titan-forgotten structure known as the “Abalathian Beacon.” It is said that, upon witnessing the beacon for the first time, the “gods” within Nald'thal's domain cried with a primal scream, and fled into the depths of the Twelveswood.\nI should point out that we are not simply referring to the primal itself, but to the abalathian falcon that flew into it. Were it not for the valiant efforts of our guards, the beast would have surely claimed the lives of all within its vicinity.\nYet, thanks to you, we are able to send a herald through the woods who can deliver the message to those within the settlement. I would ask you to accept this gift─a pair of dwarven earbuds, courtesy of the Scions─as a token of our appreciation."]
