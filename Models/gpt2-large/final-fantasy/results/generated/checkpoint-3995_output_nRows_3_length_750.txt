They slew him forthwith, and from that moment forth, he was deemed a heretic and denied the blessings of the goddess.\nNeedless to say, it wasn't long before he found his way to the House of the Fierce, where he was knighted and made a dashing figure, beloved of Radz-at-Han royalty.

As with most of my other pieces, it is meant to be enjoyed while it is being made.\nI hope you'll give the harp a try. It's a gift that will bring tears to your eyes.

Though I am not surprised to see some of the parts have been smeared with grime and rusted.\nThe fact that the engineers who built this marvel still worked to this day is something of a miracle. They must have known full well the danger this could pose.\nThis is a fine example of what can be done with an old piece of equipment. I see no reason to hold on to an old piece of weaponry─it is what it is, and what it was used for, no matter how long ago.\nThank you for your time. I hope I may call you back again someday. Now, be careful with those old kobold machines out there. I hear they can be rather difficult to take apart.']
