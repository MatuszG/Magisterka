Title: A Bargain Struck
Dialogue: ['\nGildon:', "I am glad to see you again─how I wish I could greet you in person. You've come at a good time, friend. There is a matter I wish to discuss, and I could do with someone present.\nThe matter is this: we have struck a deal with the Syndicate, and in exchange for safe passage, we've received promises of great wealth.\nI was considering how best to convey the deal to my clients, but they've yet to respond.\nI'd be grateful if you could inform my clients that they can expect a sum of gil to be delivered in the next few days.\nThe Syndicate has no doubt agreed to the terms. My thanks in advance, friend.", '\nSyntgoht:', 'The Syndicate has agreed to the terms?

Title: A Bargain Struck
Dialogue: ['\nJareck:', "\nYou've a look in your eyes I am reminded of the bargain I struck with my old friend Calpurnia. I won't go into details, of course, for we've spoken enough times. Suffice it to say, if there is any truth to it, the Syndicate will not take kindly to my proposition.\nYou see, I've been approached by a number of interested parties, and need someone to go to the Isles of Umbra in my stead.\nThere is a secret passage through the Sapsa Spawning Grounds, but the price is steep. I would not dare pass on such a rich bounty if it were not for your aid.\nI would not presume to offer you more than what you deserve, but I will not play the bait. I would take you to the Isles of Umbra, where a man of your ability could be found.", '\nCalpurnia:', '\nYou must be eager to go to the Isles of Umbra. I can think of no better place to start your investigation.', '\nCalpurnia:', '\nMy apologies, Forename. It has been far too long since last I saw you.\nI had been pondering my next step. I will need to alert the sultanate's intelligence services, and try to gain their cooperation.\nI will not trouble you with further details, only to say that I will not be back until the price is paid.\nYou have my thanks, Forename. You may now take your leave.', '\nJareck:', '\nAh, there you are. I hope the deal went well.', '\nJareck:', "\nCalpurnia, was it?
