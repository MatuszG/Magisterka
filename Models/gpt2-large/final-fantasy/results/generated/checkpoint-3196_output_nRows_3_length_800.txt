It was his dying wish that we place it on all our tools.\nHe would often call out to me when he was feeling down, asking for a piece of advice. I always gladly gave it to him.\nBut this time, he spoke of a man he had met in Amh Araeng. His name was Louisoix, and they had met on at least one occasion when they were both working in Costa del Sol.\nI knew immediately that he had been touched by the plight of the refugees, and that he would be willing to lend his knowledge to us.\nI am honored to have been asked to make this gift, and I hope you will continue to use it in your work. Thank you again for your help!']
