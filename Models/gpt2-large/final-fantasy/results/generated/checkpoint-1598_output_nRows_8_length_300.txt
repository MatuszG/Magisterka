Aye, I reckon I could use a bit of help.\nA friend of mine is a chocobo hunter, and he's been tasked with bringing me the birds I've been ordered to hunt. But he's been...bored to the point of being...unproductive.\nInstead of hunting, he's been plopping them on the ground and frolicking around. That's got to be a damn sight better for it than standing around and doing nothing.\nI've tried to get him to do some work, but I've been rebuffed. I'd get the birds myself, but I have a job to do here, and I know you're an able sort.\nI'm going to ask you to go and get some fresh meat for him, but I need you to hurry.\nThe birds are to the north of here, and it'll take you a while to get there.
