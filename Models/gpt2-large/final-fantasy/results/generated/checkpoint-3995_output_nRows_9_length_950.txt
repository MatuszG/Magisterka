It is not inconceivable that the device was disabled remotely, rendering the airship unable to carry out its intended mission.\nGiven these circumstances, I have no doubt that the Enterprise will come under attack.

It is our hope that you will not need to use the device in this manner, however, for we have already ascertained that it will not be of much use against the Garleans.\nYou will be staying with us for a time.

Dialogue: ['\nEadbert:', '\nSir? Sir, I require your aid. I have a task that I would entrust to none other, and I would entrust it to you, if you would be so kind as to perform it.\nI would have you procure for me a golden lute. I have already given it to a servant, but that instrument has grown old and worn out. I would have it repaired, but I know full well that such a task is not within the means of a mere automaton.\nIf you can bring me a similar instrument, I would be in your debt. And if you should happen to have need of a similar item while en route, I would be most grateful if you could deliver it to my servant, who awaits you at the Red Rooster Stead.', '\nEadbert:', '\nSir, I pray this is not your automaton. Ah, yes, I see─you are indeed the automaton I have seen. I trust you have the lute.\nI will repair the lute as I have always done. It was my life's work, and I will take care of it until the day I die.\nNow, may I ask you a question? I would like to know how you feel about this instrument. I understand that an instrument can mean so much, but I would ask only how you feel about it.\nBy the ease with which you have restored it to its former glory, I must assume that it is a precious instrument to you. It is, I believe, one of the most important tools we possess─a means of accessing the eremitons' guidance.\nWhen we worship our gods, we utilize instruments to aid in our comprehension of their words. From the time of the Flood, we have relied upon them to such an extent that we now speak with an uncanny degree of clarity, as if we were speaking with a living being.\nIt is for this reason that I continue to make use of my automaton, though I am certain that someday, it will simply be out of service. I do not wish to keep you from your task, then.']

Dialogue: ['\nZlatan:', "\nAccording to Master Gerolt, the Resistance weapons' cores are all assembled and ready to fire.\nBut while the weapons are in the possession of the Resistance, they are not to be used to their full potential. No, their cores must be refined further.\nA number of cores have been deemed too weak to refine further, and so they have been sent to Ul'dah to be improved.\nIn exchange for these cores, the House of Splendors has petitioned the Crystal Exarch to procure crystallized sun crystals.\nThese crystals are common enough, and even I should be able to procure them.\nBut the Exarch is of a mind that cannot be so easily convinced. I have been sent to tutor him on the use of his new toy, the Blessed Wand.\nHe is due back from his mission in the Confessional, and I would have you wait for him by the door leading out of the solar.", '\nZlatan:', '\nAnd who might your tutor be?', '\nZlatan:', "\nAh, Forename Surname. I was certain he would be away by now.\nYou are doubtless eager to complete your new toy's refinement. As I've already explained, a core is composed of a number of tiny crystal pieces. Each piece is then joined with another piece of crystal, refining the weapon's properties.\nTo ensure the Resistance weapons' unique properties are not diminished, each core is reinforced with a gold-plated hilt.\nNot unlike the bow you currently hold in your hand, the Resistance weapons will utilize a unique combination of crystal and metal to enhance their properties.\nWhen your weapon has been refined, you will receive a reward commensurate with its capacity.\nI should hope you won't have need of the bow, but if you desire a similar relic, you may find one in Ul'dah's Black Shroud.\nThere you will find another hilt, this time reinforced with a silver bangle.\nLikewise, if you desire another relic, you may find one in Ul'dah's Black Shroud.\nThere you will find another hilt, this time reinforced with a gold-plated gorget.\nEither of these pieces may be reused to further enhance your weapon. I suppose you could say it's like trading your old toy for a new one...\nWell, I think you can see where this is going.\nAs your tutor has already explained, a weapon's capacity is measured in points. The higher the number, the more powerful the weapon becomes.\nAnd the Resistance weapons are no exception.\nAs your reward, you will also receive a fitting payment. Should you choose to retain your weapon, you will also receive a suitable amount of Revenant's Tail.\nI hope you won't feel obligated to part with it, but if you desire another relic, you may find one in Ul'dah's Black Shroud.\nThere you will find another hilt, this time reinforced with a silver bangle.\nLikewise, if you desire another relic, you may find one in Ul'dah's Black Shroud.\nOh, and before you go, if you have any questions concerning the refinement of your weapon, I am always here to answer them.\nNow that you've received your reward, would you like to hang onto your weapon? It won't be long until your weapon has received its final treatment, so it would be best if you could keep it safe."]

He was also the first to successfully commercialize the use of nanotechnology. And when it came to the Gatling cannon, Vavapu was the man who single-handedly conceived of the entire concept.\nNeedless to say, most believe him to be a self-proclaimed “god” who is constantly meddling in the affairs of others. A true visionary, no doubt, but who would deny the man a few simple words of encouragement?\nIf you're wonderin' who this Vavapu guy is, you've come to the right place. He's a quiet sort, but when he gets to talking, his passion's infectious!\nNow, you might be thinkin' nothing of all this talkin' 'bout a forgotten hero like Vavapu. But if you take a moment to listen to him, you'll be amazed at just how much he means to this world.\nAnyroad, I hope you enjoyed hearin' him tell you about his mentor, and that you should go out and speak with him if you have the time. He's a great man, and you'll be doin' the world a great service!"]

We could not have done a better job of conveying the message.\nIt is with great pride that I would share with you my findings on the nature of souls and souls' desires.\nIn my opinion, a soul is a collection of thoughts, feelings, and memories that are passed on to the next life. And by the time a soul reaches its final destination─if it even exists at all─it has been thoroughly analyzed and refined.\nWhile my research is focused on the souls of my deceased comrades, I have made inquiries into the desires of my new acquaintances─those whom you met in the Akadaemia Anyder.\nMy inquiries yielded surprising results. While most would agree that people desire what is best for their future, my inquiries unearthed a realm of preferences that were altogether unexpected.\nAnd so it was that I founded this institute, dedicated to the pursuit of happiness. Our work is hampered, however, by the fact that our techniques are not entirely free of impugnations.\nBut you have overcome such obstacles, and in so doing, have brought us one step closer to achieving our true dream: the liberation of souls.

And from that it was born the legend of the Resistance, which continues to this day.\nSo be it─the song tells us that we must be brave and resolute, regardless of the cost.\nThat is why it is so important that you keep your own strength in check, and you must be prepared to bear whatever it takes to achieve your dreams.\nThat is why I will sing the song to you again, from the bottom of my heart.\nOnce you have learned the meaning of the song, I hope you will be inspired to live by its words, and take up your sword and shield once more!

My subordinates were not able to tell you what transpired here, but I am relieved to see you safe.\nThough this is but a small step, I remain confident our troops will return to the field of battle soon enough.\nThat said, we cannot take our victory for granted. We must earn it by proving to the Garleans that we are not so easily overcome by defeat.\nThat is why I have asked you to deliver these last few supplies to my subordinates. If they are able to fulfill their duties admirably, I am sure they will return to the field of battle.']
