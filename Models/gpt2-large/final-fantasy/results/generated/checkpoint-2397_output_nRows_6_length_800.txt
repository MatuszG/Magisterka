Suffice it to say, I'm glad to see you're not entirely devoid of compassion.\nHmmm...I'll wager that you've never seen a beekeeper so utterly devoid of self-awareness.\nIn that case, I suppose it only fair that you should know of my plight. It was my intent to set up a small, but apiary in the vicinity of Fallgourd Float, but it soon became clear that the place wasn't suited for my needs.\nI was resigned to letting it fall to the wayside, but then a visitor from the surface appeared who had a different idea─one that I could respect.\nThat visitor was a man named Erik, and I owe him a debt of gratitude. I wish to thank him for his counsel, and ask that he convey my gratitude to the rest of my colleagues.\nAnd speaking of whom─I've had a few nibbles of honey, so perhaps you can take it as payment for your efforts.\nI look forward to hearing from you again soon.

The cores are more precious than you may realize, however.\nIn ancient times, the dragons wielded incredible power. The destruction they wrought upon the land would rival that of the Flood in its devastation.\nThis was the era of the Warrior of Light, who united the people of Eorzea to overcome the might of the dragons. The wisps were his companions, and their defeat is what sealed his fate.\nNow, it falls to the Warriors of Light to protect the peace between our lands. To this end, we must bestow upon them the power to vanquish the great wyrm.\nIf the wisps were to perish, so too would the land's future be diminished. The only way for us to ensure the future is to bestow upon them the power to vanquish the great wyrm.\nIt is for this purpose that the wisps are bestowed upon adventurers, that they might carry out the will of the aether-loving people.\nThe wisps themselves are a part of a greater plan, a greater plan for the future. And I am certain that when the time comes for us to bestow the powers upon the wisps, it will be for the best."]
