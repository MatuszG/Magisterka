And no, I'm not some figment of the imagination of some bored military man. I'm a professional.\nI've even got a degree in music, you can hear for yourself if you head west along the coast. You'll find me just up the path there.\nNow, before we can talk about anything else, I'd best teach you a bit about the instrument I'll be using.\nYou'll find the fret board in the left hand corner of the Geiko Daisen. That's where you'll find the two wooden pieces that make up the hi-hat's main body.\nNow, before you can even begin playing, you'll need to pick out the right pitch for your voice. That's something you can't just look at─you have to know what the notes mean to you.\nHere's the pitch for the high-pitched note. It's the note that starts the song. In other words, the note you want to sing at the very beginning.\nNow, for the low-pitched note. It's the note that goes into the chorus. In other words, the note you want to end the song with.\nFinally, for the long-pitched note. It's the note that finishes the song. In other words, the note you want to play at the very end.\nNow, you've learned the notes, but what do you actually need to know? That's a question that many a beginner will be wondering.\nWell, it's definitely not a beginner's problem. You don't even have to be a professional to be able to play an instrument.\nIf you think you've got the ability, there's no limit to what you can achieve.\nI believe that's what my friend Yugiri was telling you before─she was saying that even the most accomplished geiko could be as good as dead people.\nMaybe that's why she's here, playing with you. She's one of the most accomplished of all the geiko, and she knows a thing or two about survival.\nIf you ever have the chance, you should go and have a chat with her. You'll find her just up the path to the west.", '\nGraceful Geiko:', "Ah, you're back! I hope you didn't forget the pitch.\nNow, I've taught you the basic techniques, but there's one more thing I want to show you.\nBy using these two pieces of wood, you can create your very own hi-hat.\nIf you were to play this old-fashioned instrument with your voice, you'd be able to recreate the sound of folk songs from all eras. Folk songs are some of the most beautiful pieces of music ever written.\nOf course, you'd need a little practice before you could even attempt to recreate the sounds of Daenokuki, the goddess of wisdom and knowledge. But with a little bit of practice, you can start playing at your own pace, and even challenge your ears.\nSo,
