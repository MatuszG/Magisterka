I will examine the offspring to see what has made them so different.", '\nBriardien:', 'You have returned with the eggs? Very good.\nI have never seen the like of these horns. Were they merely local?

Dialogue: ['\nKee-Satt:', "\nThe journey ahead is long and arduous, but I have faith that we'll make it, and that you'll return safe and sound.\nI knew that I could count on you. Now I just need you to─\nWait! Don't leave me like this! I need to finish what I started!\nOh, thank goodness. I am so glad that we met.\nBefore I explain what I plan on doing, I need to teach you about my duties as a soldier.\nI was born and raised in the mountains of Coerthas, but I have been stationed in the Near East for the past several years. I was trained as an archer, but I've since switched to a lancer.\nMy duties have kept me here for the most part, but as I said, they've kept me here for the longest time. While I know this is sudden, I worry that my old training could be undone by sudden hardships.\nSo please, go and find my old mentor, Gontrant, in eastern La Noscea. He should be able to assist you.\nAnd while you're searching for him, please tell him that I sent you, and ask for his assistance as well. It would mean a lot to him.", '\nGontrant:', "\nYou're here! What can I help you with?\n...Ah, of course. You're here to learn about how I became a lancer, are you?\nWell, I suppose that is a fair enough explanation.\nIt's an extremely difficult and demanding discipline, but it also requires a great deal of mental focus and discipline if you're to make even small gains.\nWhen I first joined the Company, I had never led an army in battle. I was assigned to the eastern front because I was told it was where the bloodiest battles were fought, but I found myself easily distracted and ineffective.\nEven though I knew I wasn't good at it, I was told that I needed to practice, and I did. Every day.\nAfter a while, though, I began to think that perhaps I wasn't improving as fast as I should. I wanted to try something new, but I knew I couldn't do it alone.\nSo I asked a friend of mine─a veteran of more than a decade's battle─if he could find me something new to do. He found me a bit further down in the ravine, and there we spent the next few weeks learning various techniques together.\nI was so absorbed in our lessons that I nearly lost track of time. I found myself procrastinating endlessly on my training, and by the end of it I was so exhausted that I nearly passed out from exhaustion.\nI knew right then that I needed to slow down. I knew I had to make a fresh start, and I did.\nI decided to focus on one technique at a time, and after a few weeks I was able to build up a small amount of momentum. I'm now ready to move on to my next lesson.\nPlease give my old mentor my regards when you find him. It would mean a lot to him."]

Dialogue: ['\nMaira:', "\nI can see from your grim expression that you've not yet fully grasped the concept of child rearing. Allow me to explain.\nIf you're to be a proper father to a child, you must: a) provide them with a loving home, and b) provide them with opportunities to grow and learn.\nNot being able to provide either of those things is a complete waste of my time. Which is why I'm going to explain exactly what it is I and my husband want for our little bundle of joy.\nBut before I do, let me just...there's something I need to do. I need to go and...and meet...them.\nI wouldn't be able to do it myself, of course, so I need someone I can trust to go in my stead. Someone I can look after while I'm away.

I don't know how I can possibly repay you for all of your help.\nYou see, Maira is a ward of House Fortemps. She's a ward of House Fortemps because her father was a knight of the House of Durendaire, and she herself was wed to House Durendaire's youngest son.\nThe marriage was arranged by the elder brother of House Fortemps, who happened to be the eldest son. When the elder brother died, Maira was wed to the younger.\nAfter a short while she was taken into House Fortemps by her mother. She's been raising her brother and sister here ever since.\nEver since she was a child, she's been attending the same school as our other children. It's been her dream to join the other children in the Warrior's Guild, but she's been too shy to approach anyone in her own right.\nSo when I heard about your task, I knew I just had to help. I'm going to go and talk to her about getting herself registered as a father.\nIf you could go and talk to Maira first, though, I'd be ever so grateful. It'll give me an idea of what sort of help I could offer.\nSpeaking of which, I suppose I should give you a reward for your help.
