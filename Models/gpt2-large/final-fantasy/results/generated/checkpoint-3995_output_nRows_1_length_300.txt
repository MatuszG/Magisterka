I've been assigned to the Eastern Front, where I'm serving as a liaison officer.\nI was just on my way to meet with our allies in Yerugaya today when I received word that the Maelstrom has struck a deal with the Ixal.\nIf you're familiar with the Ixal, you'll know that they've been carving up territory in the South Shroud. The Garleans, on the other hand, seem to be pursuing a strategy of their own, one that envisions establishing a permanent military presence in the region.\nThis has raised a number of questions in my mind, none of which I'm willing to answer until I see the documents themselves.\nCould you give me a hand?\nThe documents you seek are at the Foreign Brigade in Ul'dah. Seek out Commander Rhiki there, and she will brief you on the details.", '\nRhiki:', "\nAh, Forename, it's been too long. So, what did you learn of the deal between the Maelstrom and the Ixal?\nAh, Cibleroit said to expect an officer from the Foreign Brigade here.

Far from it. There are certain items that are so coveted that even the wealthiest merchants are wont to pay exorbitant prices for them.\nThat being said, I am a firm believer that the individual who makes the first move should always bear the final decision.\nThat is why I have asked Gold Saucer employee Roseline to analyze the current market and see what she can come up with.\nIf you are willing, pray meet with her in the Acorn Orchard at your earliest convenience.", '\nRoseline:', "\nGreetings, sir.

This in turn has forced me to reconsider my arrangement with the Brass Blades, and so I must needs recant my earlier statement.\nAlas, I am unable to do so in person.
