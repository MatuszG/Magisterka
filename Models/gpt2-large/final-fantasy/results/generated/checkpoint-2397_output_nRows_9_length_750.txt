Were you able to find the patrol?', '\nLalai:', '\nAh, yes. They were headed towards the lake, but there were no signs of struggle.\nThat's good news─the patrol should be safe.\nI was also told the beasts encountered a number of Qiqirn on the way, which could mean the encounter was more than one.\nI'll head back to the Watcher's Palace and confirm the patrol's safety.\nThank you, Forename. I can see you're eager to make a name for yourself as a trustworthy adventurer.']

Dialogue: ['\nGerolt:', "\nI owe ye my life, adventurer.\nI was sent out to the western highlands to secure supplies for our men when we heard the Empire's call.\nI fought bravely, and in the end, I took a terrible wound that would have been fatal if not for the medicine I was to carry. I couldn't return to my post, and so I asked for leave to wander the wilds.\nI saw many of the wilds, but none so majestic as this towering structure. I couldn't help but wonder─were I to fall in, would I make it back to my comrades?

Do you think you could do me a favor and find me a wild boar?\nI would hate to ask a favor of another, but could you find me a wild boar and deliver it to me?

My comrades will be delighted to see this.\nYou see, the ruins are said to house relics from the age of the Empire. Those excavated so far have been said to house ancient magitek weaponry, and─as rumored─crystals used to power magitek armor.\nI had hoped to explore these ruins myself, but the wounds I took from those vile beasts nearly ended my career. I thank you for saving my life.']

Dialogue: ['\nZlatan:', "\nAccording to Master Garlond, the means by which emotional energies are committed to the Resistance weapon is perhaps the most crucial part of the refinement process.\nA single faulty component could irrevocably damage the weapon, and we can ill afford to have the element of surprise slip past our defenses. That is why we have been testing a new type of alloy that we believe may be more suitable for this purpose.\nIt is a creation of our own, and though we have received some preliminary reports, we are still in the midst of evaluating its suitability for use in the field.\nSomehow, the House Dzemael engineers have contrived a means by which they can remotely activate a portion of the alloy's innards when it is in use, thereby allowing them to adjust their weapon's parameters at will. We are grateful for their assistance, but be warned─the element of surprise is not to be taken for granted.\nYou will find the element of surprise in the form of a crystal found within the chest in the Aery. When you have acquired it, please deliver it to Commander Garlond for inspection.", '\nZlatan:', "\nI trust you have the crystal? Excellent, excellent.

Dialogue: ['\nEmaniette:', "Ah, Forename. Might you have a moment?\nI was recently approached by an elderly gentleman who wished to meet me at a place we both know well─the church at Dammroen Field.\nI am not a member of the Order of the Twin Adder, but I know many who are. It would mean much to me if you would accompany me in my stead.\nIn case you are unfamiliar, the church is said to be where a group of monks who sought to meditate on the nature of existence passed away some time ago.\nI am unsure how old he is, but if he is indeed over sixty, I would suggest he first seek out Brother Wedge. He should be able to tell you more.\nThank you, Forename. You have done me a great service.\nI shall be praying for his safety. Please pass along my greetings to him.", '\nWedge:', "Forename, the Holy See is in your debt. Brother Wedge has told me all about you.\nI knew Brother Wedge would be pleased to hear from you, but I was even more pleased to hear that he informed you of the nature of Brother Emaniette.\nBrother Emaniette is a great man, and I am honored to have known him. Yet, in spite of his great age, he is not without kindness. I am certain that had he the time, he would have welcomed you with open arms.\n...And yet, he is confined to his bed, unable to move. What has become of him? I pray for his safety."]

In fact, I hope that by sharing my sorrows with you, you'll be able to put a little more joy into my life.\nYou should have no trouble finding the mamagnus in question. They're said to dwell beneath the succulent roots of the succulent shrub, and I'd wager you can find one just about anywhere.\nOnce you've found one, return to me and I'll see that you're duly compensated.", '\nAnantasister:', "\nAh, you're back. Have you brought the mamagnus I asked for?\nBy the gods, you're not letting me down!\nMamagnus are a root vegetable of sorts─they're quite an acquired taste, and growing them is a painstaking task.\nI've tried various methods of preparing them, but nothing quite compares to boiling them in a soup. The result─no matter how flavorful─is simply incomparable.\nMamagnus soup is a wonderful way to end the day, and it truly brings a smile to my face to know that my friend is still going strong.\nI'm sure you'll be wanting more, though. Here, I'll give you more of what you've gotten, and I hope that someday, you'll be able to offer me that same kindness."]

Title: A Brief Reprieve
Dialogue: ['\nTaina:', "\nYou there. You look like a man who knows how to fight. I'm in need of a capable warrior to help me on my journey.\nI'm on my way to hunt down a band of Garleans that have made a nest on the moon, but I'm having trouble finding anyone who's willing to come with me.\nYou, however, look like you can handle yourself in a fight. Could you go ahead and slay the creatures for me? I'm sure that if you slay four of them, that should be enough.", '\nTaina:', "\nYou've slain the Garlean beasts, then? That is good news indeed.\nI had heard talk of the existence of these nests, but I had no idea they were so massive. I was sure the beasts would be easy prey if I tried to go after them myself, but I'm confident that you'll be able to take them down with relative ease.\nI'll be sure to reward you for your help. Thank you again for your help."]

Title: A Brief Reprieve
Dialogue: ['\nOboro:', "\nForename, I see you've returned. Well, I trust that this is your first time on the wood.\nAs you may know, I've been charged with leading a patrol of the forest─a job that sees me through the most perilous of places─and it has been a trying time.\nYou see, the forest is home to a myriad of creatures and beasts─some more fearsome than others─which I must keep at bay with my bow.\nUnfortunately, one of those beasts has been feeding on the carcass of a fallen adventurer. I would ask you to thin the herd by capturing a few of its smaller kin, but I cannot leave my post at the moment.\nI have given you a wide berth thus far, but I would be most grateful if you could bring me back some of the creature's meat.\nA simple kill such as this would go far in sparing the lives of my colleagues and myself. ", '\nOboro:', "\nA simple kill such as this would go far in sparing the lives of my colleagues and myself. ", '\nOboro:', '\nDo you have what I seek?', '\nOboro:', "\nOh, thank you. You've saved my hide this day, and for that I owe you my life.\nYou see, the beast that devoured the adventurer was a member of a different order─a sort that Oboro himself belonged to once.\nAs such, he was not alone in this world, and the two of us─himself and his friend─were consigned to this existence together.\nAfter we both received our death sentence, we drifted apart, and I think we both died in this world.\nWhen I think of it now, it was all a tragic waste. But that is neither here nor there, I suppose.\nRegardless, we live in a momentary blip on the chronicles of time─a momentary blip that will never be repeated.\nMy thanks for returning the meat. You have done more for my comrades' morale than I can ever thank you for."]
