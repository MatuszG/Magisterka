I can only imagine the suffering they have wrought.\nIt is my hope that the combined strength of the Eorzean Alliance and the Twelveswood will be sufficient to protect the Twelveswood from these threats.\nA new chapter in the history of the Twelveswood has opened with the arrival of these two allies. I look forward to the day when they can join in the fight against the Empire."]

Dialogue: ['\nFufucha:', "\nAh, Forename. I was looking for you─the adventurer who defeated the last imperial guard─and─much to my delight─I believe you are returned!\nYou see, I was hoping to present you with a gift─one of a kind─and I believe I have chosen the most appropriate one for you.\n...A gift of sorts, you say? Yes, a gift of sorts. It is a gift of sorts─a medallion of wisdom, created especially for you by a dwarf of some renown.\nIt is inscribed with the words “From the heart of the wyrm, come to me.” The recipient is in need of its power─the more so, the more it must be guarded lest it fall into the wrong hands.\nFor this reason, I have chosen to make it a token of my gratitude to you, Forename. And I am certain you are eager to receive it, for the gift is a token of gratitude as well.\nTo help ensure that it will reach its recipient, I shall provide you with the necessary materials─crystals and crystalskin, to be precise. As you have already seen, these can be found only in the Twelveswood.\nFor the medallion itself, I shall need the blood of a black dragon. You will find this in the Forgotten Knight─the fiend responsible for the deaths of many in the wake of the Calamity.\nAnd as for the crystalskin, I shall need the cores of three crystals, which can be found in the ruins northeast of the Forgotten Knight.\nI know it may seem like a trifle to ask, but should you wish to know more, pray speak with the innkeep who is stationed there.", '\nFufucha:', "\nIf you would be so good as to seek out the innkeep who owns the Forgotten Knight, I will provide you with the necessary crystals and crystalskin.

It is, after all, a token of my profoundest gratitude.\nNow then, let us take a look at the token in question.\nA wise man does not pass judgment without investigation, does he? In the case of this token, that would be you.\nLet us examine the medallion itself, shall we?\nThe medallion is a gift of sorts─a medallion of gratitude, in fact. It was created especially for you by a dwarf of some renown, whose name I am pleased to reveal.\nI trust you have already noticed that this medallion is quite massive─far larger than any other I have seen.\nYet it is somehow still so light. I sense that this is the will of the elementals, and that its weight is a testament to the power of the bond between the keeper and the recipient.\nWhen the elementals bestowed upon the holder of the medallion such power, they did so with the knowledge that the holder would be forever safe.\nAnd now that you possess this token, you can bring the elementals' knowledge to bear upon your deeds. You have proven yourself worthy of this gift, and I am confident that you will do likewise with the next one.\nNow then, there is only one more step before we can present you with the medallion of gratitude. That is to find the recipient, and I trust that you will do the rest.\nFor this purpose, I shall send word to Camp Tranquil that you are to meet with the recipient.\nThe elementals have given you this gift, and I trust that you will do the recipient no harm. I would not ask you to do anything that would put you in danger─not unless you are certain of the outcome.\nI am certain that you will be rewarded for your efforts, and in the knowledge that you are not alone in your search. I hope that this gift will suffice to provide you with the strength to carry on."]
