The one in the west was under the rule of the Empire, while the other was under the rule of the House of Humes.\nThis division of power led to a number of misunderstandings and difficulties, some of which still exist to this day. It is for this reason that the Domingue exists as a museum of our nation's history.\nIt is for this reason that I have been charged with its care. I can think of no other who would have such a responsibility.\nAh, but listen to me prattle on. I do so hope I do not bore you with my spiel. Pray bear with me as I continue my explanation."]

It is for this reason that my brother has been tasked with procuring more of the finest vintages from Burgundy to be stored in the winery.\nIt should come as no surprise that my efforts have paid off. Having been entrusted with these orders, I am pleased to say that my brother has already made the necessary arrangements to have the wine stored.\nMy thanks to you, friend. I trust that you will not be disappointed to hear the good news.\nThe wine will be stored in vaults belonging to the Dravanian Horde. Though it is no secret that they use vaults excavated from the ruins of old Ishgard, it has long been believed that the Garleans used vaults of their own making, likely utilizing ancient magitek weaponry.\nIt was my hope that the armor and weapons recovered from the ruins would be put to use again, helping to restore the honor of our people.\nOf course, this assumes that the Dravanians will not use their vaults to further their own ends.\nBut in the event that they choose to do so, we shall be ready to defend them. My brother has already contacted me to let me know that all is ready.\nI am glad to hear that my efforts have paid off. Having made the acquaintance of the proprietor of the Dravanian Horde vaults, I now feel confident that I can safely proceed with the rest of the preparations.\nIt is now time that I take the final step in securing the wine. Having purchased more than a half-dozen vintages from Burgundy, I shall need to buy more to make up for what I had to part with.\nBuying more Burgundy wine will not be as easy as it may seem. Though the wine is sweeter and more flavorful than any other I have tasted, there is a cost to be paid.\nAnd though it may be a small step, I am confident that I can make it worth your while. For as Lord Artoirel said, 'tis the journey that makes the master wine.\nWhat say you, friend? Shall we set forth for Burgundy?\nMy lord, the journey that makes the master wine is not an easy one. It may not even be the last one you take. But if you insist, take care on your journey.

Dialogue: ['\nTutusi:', '\nHm? Yes, you have the pleasure of speaking with one of our more accomplished technicians. I am Tutusi, a technician employed by the Adventurers' Guild.\nI have the honor of working with the finest arms and armor the guild has to offer. It is for these reasons─as much as my duties as a technician permit me to specialize in any given discipline─that I would be most grateful if you would deliver this letter to my colleague.\nWith your assistance, I should be able to accomplish two things. The first is to request that you procure from our armory a piece of obsidian armor, a necessary step in preparing for the pilgrimage to Gridania.\nThe second is to solicit your thoughts on the nature of that obsidian. Should I be mistaken, I should be most obliged if you could provide the correct information.\nI realize that these requests may seem trifling at times. But, with the wealth of our armory, we are quite capable of employing every type of armory-grade material.\nOh, and I should mention that the obsidian you seek is, as you must surely realize, the very same material used to create the Black Iron Bridge.\nIt is not, however, the same material that was used to fashion the Crystal Tower. The latter was a much-maligned and ultimately failed experiment.\nIt was not, however, without irony that the Adventurers' Guild chose to develop its own line of replicas of the Crystal Tower. In order to realize the benefits of multiple uses for its materials, the guild chose to base its work on the observation that “all things are born of Time,” and thus it began manufacturing replicas of the Crystal Tower.\nWhile the replicas were of some success─and, I may add, increasingly expensive to produce─the question of what to do with the excess material presented a problem.\nFor reasons that remain unclear, the surplus materials were not put to use. Instead, they were stored in a vault, reserved for future commissions.\nI do not believe that our esteemed technician has forgotten the importance of making good use of his equipment, but might I trouble you to inquire as to how the surplus materials are used?\nWith the assistance of our armory technician, I was able to procure two pieces of obsidian armor, enough to make at least four replicas of the Crystal Tower. I realize that this may seem a paltry number, but I think it fair to say that it is more than enough.\nAs you can see, the replicas are of a far higher quality than the original, and I am pleased to say that I have been asked to evaluate them for use in the guild's training program.\nIf all is in order, I should be able to finish up my duties in the next few days. Please allow me some time to make my way to the armory.', '\nTutusi:', '\nYou have returned. Good. With this, I should be able to depart for Gridania. My thanks for your assistance.']

I've been expecting you─or rather, your friend Wedge had you come for. Well, as it happens, I've been asked to direct you to a rather peculiar place. If you're at all familiar with the Peaks, you'll know that there's a place there that offers respite from the hardships of the road. It may not be the most pleasant of places, but it is home to a man who's dedicated his life to the art of warcraft. You'll be wondering why I would entrust such a man with my most precious assets... Well, there's a matter I must needs keep in mind. You see, it has been brought to my attention that some─not all, mind you─of our stalwart allies have sought to lay claim to the Peaks. The notion that these so-called “heroes” are in fact fallen heretics is highly suspect. For whatever reason, they've taken to standing in the way, placing themselves upon the altar like so much refuse. For a man of your ability, I would not entrust my life to anyone who would trample on my honor. Now, I realize this is sudden, but might I trouble you to return to Byron's Spire and explain the situation to Ser Estinien? Pray return to the inn at your earliest convenience and make inquiries as to who may be responsible for the rising tide of heretics. In short, do whatever it takes to bring these villains to justice.", '\nFufucha:', "Welcome back, Forename. Estinien was asking about the heretics and whatnot, and I'm happy to report that he is not incorrect. At this rate, there'll be no shortage of troublemakers in the near future─and I can't rightly blame them, for as much as I'd like to. Well, I must needs keep this group in check─or at least, that's what I tell myself. Anyway, I trust you've learned a valuable lesson from this experience? Pray bear that in mind the next time you visit Byron's Spire. And while you're there, tell Estinien that I'd love to have him return and give him a piece of my mind!", '\nEstinien:', "Forename, I am Estinien, head of security here at Byron's Spire. I
