I shall have to add you to the list of people I'm grateful for. You're the very man I've been waiting for.\nThis is a far cry from when I first agreed to help the kobolds. Before I knew it, I was fighting side by side with a man who would go on to save the world─and I did it without hesitation.\nTo be honest, I was expecting someone more...capable. Someone who wouldn't be easily drawn into a fight. Someone who
