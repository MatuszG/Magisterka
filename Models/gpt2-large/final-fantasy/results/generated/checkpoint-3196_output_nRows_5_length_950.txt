You will have to do it yourself.\nI ask that you locate the Qiqirn and destroy any that you find.\nYou should do well to locate the merchant in question. It would be a terrible start to lose business if the local merchants lost their nerve.", '\nAeluuin:', '\nI pray this is not your doing.

Dialogue: ['\nVorsaile:', '\nMayhap you have heard, but we urgently need a new entomologist. A capable one. Someone who can handle the new challenges that await us.', '\nVorsaile:', "\nIf you've a mind to devote yourself to the study of bugs, then I've a task for you.\nI've asked a few of my colleagues to prepare a brief introduction to the subject, and you're welcome to a portion of it if you'd like.\nIt goes like this:\nEntomology is the study of insects. It is the study of life, and its very existence is the ultimate objective of all natural science.\nThe study of life has been hampered by a number of factors, but none more so than the advent of the parasitic wasp.\nWhile the wasps have greatly hindered our progress in the study of insects, they have also provided us with an invaluable source of new knowledge.\nThe study of life has been hampered by a number of factors, but none more so than the advent of the parasitic wasp. While the wasps have greatly hindered our progress in the study of insects, they have also provided us with an invaluable source of new knowledge.\nIn fact, one of the first lessons we learned from our wasps was that we must always be curious about what happens to our subjects once they've been put to bed. This is true even if the experiment is carried out in the laboratory.\nThe parasitic wasp is a fascinating specimen─an utterly fascinating creature, to be sure─but it is also utterly fascinating to observe.\nYou must be fascinated by it. We are. Please, go and see for yourself. The wasp larva is on the far side of the chamber.\n", '\nVorsaile:', "\nPlease go and see for yourself what happens to the wasp larva. You must be fascinated by it. We are. Please, go and see for yourself what happens to the wasp larva.", '\nVorsaile:', "\nWhat!? You've seen it too, have you?\nOf course you have! We had the wasps study our specimens for a bit, and it was fascinating to see their various reactions to various stimuli.\nThe wasps, however, seem to have lost interest in the specimens─or rather, they've given up on trying to understand them.\nPerhaps you can gain their trust by giving them a quick introduction to the study of insects?\nJust like our other subjects, the study of insects is, by its very nature, an incredibly difficult one to conduct. No matter how painstakingly we explain the concepts to our wasps, they simply do not understand it.\nBut you, on the other hand, are an accomplished scholar. You should be able to gain their trust with a simple introduction.", '\nVorsaile:', "\nSo, what did you think of our wasps' introduction?\nOh my, what have we gotten ourselves into? I thought you capable, but I was wrong─I was wrong about half of it.\nI knew I was right about you─that you were a capable individual. And now I've been proved wrong about half of it, and half of it is still new to me.\nI'm going to have to come up with a new introduction for you. Something that explains both your background and the new tasks you've been asked to undertake.\nI'll start with something simple─something that's easy for you to remember. Something that shows you've grown as an individual.\nI'm hoping that this will do it. Now, I'll just need you to go and find that wasp larva and put it to bed. I'm certain you can do it."]

Dialogue: ['\nDrest:', "\nWell, well, if it isn't my old friend Forename! I was hoping you'd come along.\nIt's about the bees. I'm planning a trip to the southwest, where there're more bumblebees. If we manage to keep the bees happy for an entire moon, I'm sure we'll have our bees to pollinate the flowers.\nOf course, we'll need the bees to stay healthy. If they're attacked by a bad bee, they can't produce fruit, you know! I'm thinking we can bait them with a few stink bombs.\nThe problem's not so much with the bees as it is with the badgers. If a bumblebee stung by a stink bomb is too frightened to move, it won't be too long before the badger comes knocking on the door.\nI should probably write up the plan, but I've got to make it worth your while. Here, take this. It's a reward for all your hard work!"]

By protecting and assisting others, I have the means to do so.\nI would very much like to continue doing what I've done.

When they cut down the weeping willow, they took with them the knowledge of how to make our harp stronger.\nI do not know what they learned of the Guardian Tree, but I know that we shall find out soon enough. We must press on, and restore the tree's branches to their former glory.\nFor now, I would ask that you take this as a token of my thanks. Now, take care on your journey.

I have tried to eliminate them, but to no avail.\nInstead, I believe a more effective solution may be found in culling the more troublesome specimens. The shoggoths inhabit the area around the central plaza─that is, the area to the east of the central plaza.\nPlease, would you be willing to cull three shoggoths for me? The area to the west is reserved for researchers. And you must be the one to do the killing, or you will be held responsible for any casualties.\nPlease, do not hesitate to do so, as I am certain the shoggoths will be far less aggressive should you be the one to do the killing.\nPlease, take this region─or what remains of it, at least─to the southeast. I will see to the shoggoths that remain.\nI realize that this will likely result in a loss of research assistants, but as this is a research facility, it is expected that some number of our creatures will cross paths with your intended targets. I only ask that you do your utmost to cull any unruly subjects that should cross your path.', '\nCharmine:', '\nPlease, go to the central plaza and eliminate any unruly subjects that should cross your path. I will see to the shoggoths that remain.', '\nCharmine:', '\nThank you for your help. I am certain your actions will result in a reduction in shoggoth numbers.\nHowever, I must admit to a bit of disappointment that my work has been left to be completed by someone else. I was certain that my colleagues and I would find a way to finish it, but I see that you and yours have faced greater difficulty.\nPerhaps, one day, I will be able to apologize for not having been able to do more. But for now, at least, I can say that I am grateful.\nI thank you once again for taking the initiative to do this research. I hope that one day you will be able to do the same for me.']

Title: A Bold Decision
Dialogue: ['\nBomott:', "\nWell met, adventurer. I'm a plucky bugger by trade, but I'm also a mighty warrior, so I'm always happy to be on the receiving end of a well-placed kick.\nThat said, I'm not one for taking things lying down. So when you offer me a challenge to a local leve, I'm like to take you up on it.\nIf you're willing, I'll lend you my sword so you can go toe-to-toe with some of the toughest fish in Limsa. I'll even throw in a few gil if you win.\nThe fish are known to feast on smaller fish, so you'll need to fight your way through them to the larger fry.\nIt's a long and grueling battle, but if you're prepared, it shouldn't be too hard.\nI can also give you a hand if you lose. If you're not, I'll see to it no one gets hurt.\nBefore I give you the details, though, I should probably explain what a local leve is. It's a competition where we pit our wits against each other to see who can best conquer the local waters.\nThe loser is deemed to have failed, and must submit their fish to be caught and brought to me.\nLimsa Lominsa is home to a number of local fish that thrive on smaller fish. The tougher the fish, the more prized the catch.\nThe fish are caught using a variety of methods, but I prefer to use traps to catch them.\nIf all goes to plan, we can even catch the fish we never got to see!\nNow then, the fish you'll be facing are some of the fiercest foes you'll have ever had the displeasure of fighting. They're like to be bristling with spikes, and will probably have a nasty habit of latching onto your sword.\nThankfully, you'll have my help. I can set up the traps that'll attract the beasts, and you just need to slay the ones that are already there.\nThe levewatches are stationed outside the village, so you can go and find them from there.\nI hope we can count on your assistance!\n"]
