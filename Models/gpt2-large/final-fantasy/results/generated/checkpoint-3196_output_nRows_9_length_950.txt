He's the reason the jobs we did in the first place were so dangerous. \nIt's a wonder any of us survived at all, let alone went on to form the Special Unit.\nBut forgive me. I'm not going to tell you the juicy tidings. You'll have to find them on your own.\nIf you're in a hurry, I suggest you speak with Wlveva. She can tell you all about the Special Unit and their bounty hunt.\nI'm sure you already know this, but the job I'm doing now requires me killing these bandit types on my own. I'd rather not be dragged into another pointless battle, so I appreciate you waiting for me.\nI'll start you off with three men. After that, I'll assign you your first task."]

Allow me to explain.\nLand-based claims are not only more convenient─they also provide ample room for expansion.\nBefore the Flood, Amh Araeng controlled a substantial portion of southern Thanalan.\nNowadays, though, the land is held in trust for the Sahagin, who have been carving it up piece by piece.\nOf course, this will change nothing─the client will still have to purchase the claims from the Amh Araeng, but at least the settlement will remain.\nIf you're in the market for some new territory, I suggest you speak with Dadanen, and take a look at what he has to offer.", '\nDadanen:', '\nYou are looking for a man by the name of Dadanen, yes?

Nevertheless, you must patiently explain to them that the instrument you play is a tool of peace, and they will come to see that it is a valuable gift that must be respected.\nParticipating in festivals will also test your patience, as you will be expected to go out of your way to perform for others regardless of the benefit to you.

I would go myself, but I cannot leave my post here. I fear I would only aggravate an existing injury, and be liable to be court-martialed for doing so. Would you be willing to go in my stead?\nThank you! I should warn you that this may be a rather grueling journey, but you have my word that you will get there in one piece.\nThe place I seek is the northern entrance to the Sohm Al foothills. Make your way to the base of the mountain, and you will find it in short order.\nOh, and if you happen to get lost, please don't make a hash of it─I am a fairly good tracker. Remember: this is a back country, and you will be crawling through brush and bone for your entire stay!', '\nGullinkambi:', '\nPlease, do not make a hash of this! Remember: this is a back country, and you will be crawling through brush and bone for your entire stay!', '\nGullinkambi:', '\nThank you ever so much! Now, I am free to return to my duties. I must say, this experience has made me appreciate the rigor with which our men are trained.\nWhile there is no denying the benefits of combat, discipline, and─most importantly─logistics, there is also much to be said for being prepared.\nWhen one is faced with a decision that calls for a one-sentence decision, such as which way to turn, one must take every available option. Should we have only one, it is easy to lose sight of others.\nBut if we are to arrive at our destination safe and sound, it is imperative that we make the right one. And as a soldier, I can tell you that I have never been prouder of an ally.\nThank you again for your help! Till next we meet!']

Dialogue: ['\nDiamanda:', '\nYou are returned, Forename. Your appearance is unchanged from last time. Is there something you require of me?\nI am tasked with recruiting new Battle Sisters. Each Battle Sister is trained to fight in a different manner from her predecessor.\nWhile this may seem to be a source of consternation to a seasoned veteran such as yourself, I must assure you that it is essential to our continued success.\nShould you wish to know more, pray speak with Battle Sister Two, Three, or Four. They will tell you more.', '\nBattle Sister Two:', '\nSo you wish to know more?\nThen I shall give you some further explanation.\nBefore joining the Sisters, you served as a mercenary. I am told you gained experience in a variety of disciplines, but none quite like that of Battle Sisters.\nIn your free time, you roamed the realm, slaying beasts and men alike. Yet for all of your experience, you did not come across any Battle Sisters who were as adept at wielding a lance as she was.\nSo it was that I came to think of how we Battle Sisters should train.\nIt was then that I began to research how best to develop our new recruits.\nThrough observation and experimentation, I came to believe that the best way to develop our new sisters was to pit them against various foes.\nThe more I learned, the more I began to understand why so many Battle Sisters find success in so many different ways.\nUltimately, I came to believe that one must match the strengths of their adversaries to their weaknesses.\nTo do so, they must practice swinging their lance in battle.\nThis is the first step in developing our new Sisters. The next step is to teach them to use it.\nBefore I could properly instruct them, however, I needed to gauge their abilities against the various foes I had observed.\nTo that end, I tasked Battle Sister Two with slaying beasts in Mor Dhona. She has since been tasked with slaying fiends in the Eastern Planks.\nWhile this is more of a trial, it is also a chance to see how they train and gain experience.\nYou should be glad to have witnessed firsthand how our new Battle Sisters train.\nThough I may not be able to personally teach them, I would like you to have this─a small token of thanks for your cooperation.\nNow, let us return to Ishgard and continue with your training. I wish you well, Forename.', '\nDiamanda:', '\nYou are returned, Forename. Your appearance is unchanged from last time.

Dialogue: ['\nDavyd:', '\nWell met, Forename. I am glad to have you with us─aside from our usual chat, of course. It has been a while since last we met, so perhaps we could do with a drink in the cave before we speak further of our work.\nI am pleased to report that the Aurum Vale is in excellent hands. The Calamity has done a great deal to prise the region from its ancient darkness, but it is no small task to restore it to what it once was.\nWe are dealing with a variety of beasts here─beasts which were not only created by the gods themselves, but which are increasingly adept at adapting to our environment.\nSome of these beasts were already present prior to the Calamity─as a consequence of the chaos wrought by the gods themselves. As a result, we have been forced to cull entire species, only to have them re-spawn elsewhere.\nWe are currently attempting to restore at least three distinct lineages of fauna to the region─the first of these being the Aurum Vale.\nThis is an area teeming with life, yet still bereft of a certain, shall we say, vital quality. It is precisely this quality that the gods sought to preserve when they created these beasts.\nIt is precisely for this reason that we must tread carefully when dealing with any potential introductions. It is our duty as researchers, after all, but we cannot do it alone.\nPlease, take this as a gesture of goodwill from the researchers working in this region─and a small token of our gratitude for your assistance in our work. May the gods continue to smile upon you.']

Hear me, I do not believe that we have ever before seen such a ferocious specimen.\nIf you wish to know the truth of the matter, then allow me to reveal it to you.\nLong ago, a marauder named Haurchefant set out on an expedition into the northern reaches. Upon returning, he discovered a cave in which he found a seal bearing the seal of the primal Garuda.\nOver the years, the seal has been passed down through the generations. It is currently housed in the Marauder's Guild.\nThe guild has since attempted to decipher the seal, but they have failed. The last attempt was some few years ago, when a marauder named Haurchefant III.\nAfter much deliberation, the decision was made to seal the seal in place. The hope is that, should Haurchefant III ever return, the seal will remain unchanged.\nThat is all the information I can tell you at present. I will not give you any more of my secrets.\nBut before that, I must ask that you perform one last favor. Take this whistle and prepare yourself.\nThe whistle contains the key to the chamber in which the treasure is to be found. I will wait here so that you can find it.\nNow, before you go, allow me to apologize for lying to you. In my heart of hearts, I know that you are not as good at reading body language as I am.\nBut I had no choice─I told you what the key is, and that is all I needed to give you the truth. All I wanted to say was that it is not very hard to find.\nNow, as I mentioned, I cannot give you the key without first giving you the truth.

Please do not hesitate to seek out Haurchefant III.", '\nHaurchefant:', "You wish to know the truth of the matter? Well, if you're so curious, then let's have a look.\nThe chamber is right over there. I'm sure you saw it with your own eyes, but to see it with mine own eyes is another matter.\nThere's something there that I need to teach you. I need to teach you the true meaning of the “treasure” that's in there.\nI'll just lie down for a bit and─oh, no─let's get this over with.", '\nHaurchefant:', "Welcome back. So, you actually found the treasure. And not a little one, either. I can't wait to show you what it's all about.\nAll right, I'll tell you what it is.

At one point, they were so nervous they started running amok, throwing themselves from one cliff to the next.\nThankfully, one of our men was sent to tail them and keep them from making a complete fool of themselves.

As you are not a member of the council, I will need you to sign the document attesting to the facts of the mission.\nNow, I believe that you have more pressing matters to attend to. When you are ready, let me know.", '\nPopmessage:', '\nYou are under attack!', '\nResistance Councilor:', "\nIt would appear that things have taken a turn for the worse.\nI am glad to see that you are unharmed, however, I cannot help but fear that this incident will serve as a catalyst for further violence.\nThe councilor will be coordinating her efforts with the Twin Adder, and I hope that this incident serves as a catalyst for further cooperation.\nI would also like to thank you once again for facilitating communications between our forces. It is thanks to you that we were able to carry out our joint endeavor.\nNow, go, and thanks for waiting."]

I am happy to see this happen.\nBut it is not all about having a good idea. Sometimes it is about taking the time to refine an idea, and seeing it through to its logical conclusion.\nFor example, when I first came to the Company, I had the distinct honor of working alongside a marauder in the service of Eorzea.\nAfter a number of arduous engagements, the two of us eventually came to the conclusion that our role in the war effort was best served by developing our own weapons.\nBut even as we were making this decision, we continued to discuss the matter of weapon development, and eventually came to a mutual understanding that, as long as the purpose of the endeavor was to improve the Resistance weapons, we would both be well served.\nIt is with great satisfaction that I can say we have reached the conclusion we set out to─and with a great deal of difficulty, too!\nNow, as you may have noticed, our work is not all about producing high-quality weapons. In order to produce them, we must also take into consideration a number of factors, such as the available resources, the skills required of our workers, and ultimately, the opponent.\nFor this reason, I am not overly concerned with the weapons' appearance. Should they prove to be of great use to our war effort, we will simply have to make them better.\nFor now, however, I can only talk about the weapons themselves. I wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors.\nYou have my deepest gratitude, Forename. I hope to one day be able to give you a similar gift, perhaps in the form of a weapon.\nUntil then, I bid you happy hunting!"]

I was hoping you might come along.\n...What? You've got an idea for us?\nReally!? Well, I'm all for it! We could go and meet the people who were there, and share our discoveries with the world! It'd be a great story!\nBut I need you to first convince everyone there that we haven't met. It's not easy convincing people of a lie, even if it's the truth.\nThat's why I need you to spread the word. Make sure everyone knows we're not faking it.\nI'm sure you have your reasons for wanting to go, but I hope we can find a way to make it work. I just hope you don't have to convince everyone here first.", '\nTataru:', "\nAye, I heard your tale. And I agree with everything you said! We should go and meet the people who were there.\nI'm sure you have your reasons for wanting to go, but I hope we can find a way to make it work.

Dialogue: ['\nHaurchefant:', "\nAh, Forename. I have a favor to ask of you.\nI have been keeping this to myself, lest I worsen Medrod's paranoia, but I have been having second thoughts about my proposal.\nWhen I first broached the subject with my friends, they all expressed grave doubts as to my ability to proceed. Yet I suspect they are simply unwilling to believe that I might be mistaken.\nI fear that if I tell them that I am in fact the wisest among them, they will abandon me in a fit of rage.\nIf you are willing to help, I would have you meet with our allies at Redwald's Spire. I will pay you for your troubles and make certain they do not harbor ill will toward me.", '\nVorsaile Heuloix:', '\nYou wish to proceed with the marriage? May I ask why?', '\nVorsaile Heuloix:', "\nI can think of no good reason to barter our alliance for a short-term partnership.\nWe cannot permit Medrod to continue to hold his own against our allies. Nor can we expect him to subordinate himself to a man who would undermine our efforts to purge the void.\nI will not abandon this alliance, Forename. But I will seek to ensure that it is not severed completely. I will remain close to our borders─at least for the time being.\nI am loath to impose upon you further, but I ask that you seek out our allies at Redwald's Spire and explain your intentions. I will ensure that they do not harbor ill will toward you.", '\nPop:', '\nYou sense a hostile presence!']

Dialogue: ['\nLaniaitte:', "\nAh, Forename. I was hoping you might come along.\nAs you know, the fortress was abandoned following the fall of Castrum Centri. We've been working to restore the magitek weaponry and armor, but...the work has been hampered by a number of factors.\nSome of the key pieces we need to complete our work are outside the base. I would like you to procure them for us so we can continue with our work.\nIf you're willing, I've asked Marcette to procure two sets of magitek armor for us. They can be found in the storage area.\nPlease bring them to me.", '\nMarcette:', '\nHmmm... These should be easy enough to procure.

I should have been a bit more patient with you.\nI know I should have been a bit more patient with you, but I had to make a difficult decision. I had to save these pieces─the very least I could do to repay you for your help is to give them to you.\nI'm sorry that I wasn't more helpful. I will do my best to make up for it in other ways, but please accept this as a token of my apology."]
