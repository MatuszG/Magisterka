Dialogue: ['\nDrest:', '\nYou there, adventurer! Yes, you! You are the familiar who is familiar with my work─are you not?\nYou see, in my research into the history of Eorzea, I have stumbled across a passage which contains a remarkable claim.\nIt states that, upon the death of a loved one, the soul of that which was closest to them, if they were indeed immortal, will journey to the Material World and reside there until the time comes for them to return.\nThis is an idea which, if true, would explain how Eorzea's most talented shinobi─such as ourselves─are able to exist after they have passed.\nI cannot vouch for the veracity of this claim, however, as I have only been granted a limited access to the Site. It is for your own good, however, that I would ask for your assistance.\nIf you would take this sealed letter to a man named Umineko in the Shikaku District, he will be able to ascertain whether or not this is indeed the case.\nPlease, make your way to the Shikaku District and speak with Umineko. He will be able to ascertain whether or not this is indeed the case.', '\nUmineko:', "\nAh, you are back. I hope all is well with you.\nA letter? Let's see here... Oh my, this looks to be from Drest.\nI'm told he went on a journey with his soul to the Material World, and that his soul then resided there until he returned. He died a man, yes, but he also lived a remarkable life. He was a good shinobi, a noble soul who devoted his days to the clan and his village.\nHe died at the age of forty-five, but his soul has been with us ever since. It pains me to see him go, but I know he would want us to know.\nI will write this down, for he and his family need it.\nPlease tell Drest I will contact him as soon as I have more information. I'm sure he would be proud to know his son is in good hands."]

Dialogue: ['\nHihira:', "\nA beeautiful plan, indeed. We will require neither a single ally nor a single enemy to accomplish our objectives.\nWe shall focus on the syrphid larvae that infest the ruins here. We shall draw them out so that they come to the surface and sting our prey.\nShould they be sufficiently weakened, we may then extract a poison from their poison gland. This will ensure that they cannot conceal their existence from their hosts for a prolonged period.\nThe poison will also serve to discourage any further reproduction. Thus, it will be a valuable contribution to the cause.\nThe syrphid larvae are said to be nasties by nature. If left unattended, they will inevitably evolve to become something even more terrible.\nThat said, it is not entirely out of the question that they be destroyed one day. Should they become too much for us to handle on our own, we may revert to using other means.\nFor now, we must be content with nips to the beeautiful's sting. I will arrange for some live samples to be brought up from the ruins.\nThank you again for your aid, and please inform Lady Hihira that we shall be making a full recovery.", '\nHihira:', "\nThank goodness you came.

He will not forsake his comrades, no matter what. He must be given a chance.\nWe must find a way to protect him. But, like all soldiers, he must also train to maintain his skills.\nHe has been training tirelessly, but the day is yet to come. I fear he is too far gone to recover.\nI pray he lives.

He was stationed at Revenant's Toll, out in Lakeland.\nIt was there that a young Ishgardian girl was wed to his commanding officer. The couple had a son, who was named after the Azure Dragoon's favorite hero.\nEver since that fateful day, the boy has been haunted by the memory of his father. He longs to have his father's armor, and for that, he seeks the legendary armor of the Azure Dragoon.\nBut he will not get it from you. Not on my account. He cannot, not alone.\nThe legend of the Azure Dragoon is said to have a hundred thousand pieces. Each piece is a treasure in its own right. Each piece is a talisman that can grant its owner great power.\nThe boy has set out to hunt these pieces, and I have been helping him. Together, we will surely find our father's armor, and then we will set off to reclaim it.\nPlease, take this as a token of my father's hope for the future. I will not forsake him, no matter what.', '\nAlisaie:', 'I am heartily glad you and Alphinaud are on the same page.

Dialogue: ['\nDanyell:', "Well, that was a most unusual meeting. I see no reason to delay in reporting back to Master Surname.\nThere has been a great deal of discussion regarding the sylphs' awakening. I share your concern that they may attack our people without provocation.\nHowever, I firmly believe that the sylphs' desire to commune with the elementals is entirely natural.\nThe sylphs once lived in harmony with the primals, and the spirits of the forest guide them to do so again.\nThe sylphs' desire to commune with the elementals is not entirely benevolent, however. It is possible that they seek to use the power of the elementals to their advantage.\nIf the sylphs are indeed benevolent, they will not hesitate to use it.\nWhile it is entirely possible that they will not use their power for good, it is also entirely possible that they will do so out of necessity.\nEither way, I would like to think that we can learn something of their intentions from this meeting.\nIf you would be willing to go to Treespeak Stables and conduct a second survey, I would like you to collect anything you can that may be of interest to us.\nI would like you to collect anything you can that may be of interest to us. Report back to me once you have collected it.", '\nDanyell:', "Ah, back already! Were you able to learn anything of the sylphs' intentions?\n...Then I suppose we have naught to report.\nWhat was the purpose of that gathering at Treespeak Stables? Were they trying to gather information?\nThat is a rather curious request. Why would they go to such lengths to gather information? If they are attempting to communicate with the elementals, surely they would not─\nWait! Did you hear something?\nThe sylphs spoke of a great power that would be unleashed should the sylphs' spirit be united with the primals.\nThis power could only be summoned by the sylphs' bond with the elementals.\nIn order to prevent this, the sylphs chose to end their own existence. It is my understanding that this was done by placing a mark upon their foreheads.\nIt is my understanding that this mark was a symbol of the hope that the sylphs still have for their people.\nTo place a mark upon yourself is to ask for help. I can only assume that you are eager to aid the sylphs, and so I ask that you collect this mark.\nI ask that you collect the sylphs' hope symbol from Treespeak Stables. Report back to me when you have it.", '\nDanyell:', 'So, the sylphs were not trying to summon their power? That is good news indeed!\nThe sylphs have the elementals' seal, which prevents them from summoning their power. This is, of course, perfectly in accordance with the sylphs' wishes.\nThe sylphs will doubtless wish to use this seal to prevent their own destruction, but I have no doubt that we can peacefully coexist with them.\nIf the sylphs are truly benevolent, they will not─will not─use their power for evil.\nThe sylphs are a people, and their needs are paramount. As such, it is in the best interests of both Gridania and the sylphs to live in harmony.\nThank you for your continued cooperation. I hope to receive word of great benefit from your efforts.\nForename, I

We are currently developing a treatment for this which will be delivered through the use of a feeding tube.\nUnfortunately, we do not have a suitable sample for this procedure.\nThough we have tried to acquire more as far as possible, it seems there is still much to be done before we can begin.\nI fear I am at a loss for what to do next.
