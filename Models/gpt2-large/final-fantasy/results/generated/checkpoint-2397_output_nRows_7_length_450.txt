He can tell you more about how to get involved.", '\nOutfitter:', "\nWelcome to Reunion. I take it you've come to help our Resistance fight the Vanu?\nBy the Twelve, this place was built by some of the least bloody “foolhardy” of the Vanu. The place's a damn shame, all the more so because of the way the Vanu took over.\nThe settlement is teeming with life, and some of the bravest men and women I've ever met are stationed here. But the Vanu took over when we didn't have the means to defend ourselves.\nTo make matters worse, the leader of the settlement is a veteran of the Vundu─one of the most fearsome Vundu hunters in all of Thanalan.\nI mean no disrespect, but he has proven himself far more capable than any of his peers. It would be a shame to lose him, but the Vundu are the only ones we can count on.\nPlease take this hunting log. It contains information on a number of Vundu that are believed to be of great help to our cause. Let's see if we can't find one who can lend us his aid."]
