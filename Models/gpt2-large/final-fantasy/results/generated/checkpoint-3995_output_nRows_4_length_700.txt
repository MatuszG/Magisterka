Rowena has never been one to shy away from a challenge.  ...But if it is a matter of policy, well...that is settled.  \nNow then, I believe you have a task for me.   Please be careful.   It is a dangerous game, and I can't well have anyone else know of it.', '\nAlisaie:', "So Rowena has agreed to meet with you in person, but only because you're the only one who knows how she got to Rowena in the first place?   Well, that's a relief.   Still, it's not like she's going to ask you to do anything you don't want to do.  Still, you've played your hand, and now it's up to you to play your part.  What do you say?  What do you say?", '\nAlisaie:', "Good, clean work.   I should hope that means she's willing to let you go and play your part, but I have no doubt she'd insist on going.

Your diligence in researching how best to make use of all these materials was genuinely surprising.\nPotential uses for all manner of metal are endless, but what makes Garlean steel unique is the manner in which it was forged.

It is only right that you share in the credit for it, of course.\nYou are doubtless wondering just why the House of Splendors would deem this material worthy of their trust.\nFor a start, it is made using a unique alloy of high-purity aether. It is more resistant to heat and abrasion than other metals, and thus is ideal for use in weapons that are both heat and abrasion resistant.\nIt is also of the highest quality, ensuring that every part of the weapon is of the utmost quality.\nThe House of Splendors was careful to choose materials that would not clash with each other, so as to make the best possible weapon.\nIn fact, the House itself was founded upon a conviction that all weapons should be crafted with the utmost care.\nYou will find no better example of this in all of Thanalan, my friend.\nWhen the House of Splendors was founded, they declared that all weapons must be crafted with the utmost care. Not a single one was to be found in their arsenal that was not worthy of the highest praise.\nThat conviction has carried over into their weapons, which continue to be praised by both parties concerned.\nI should mention at this point that while I am not a member of the House of Splendors, I have no doubt that they would be glad to have you as a part of their team.\nYou are welcome to visit again, my friend. I would be happy to answer any questions you may have.", '\nGerolt:', "\nWell, I'd best get back to work, then.

If you have a moment, I would discuss something that has caught my attention.\nIn recent days, I have been conducting research into the history of Bozja and the surrounding region. One of the findings I made was that, contrary to popular belief, the city was not always populated by theocrats.\nHistorically, the Bozjan people have been a people who have long perceived outsiders with suspicion. Even today, there are many who feel unwelcome in the city.\nBut nothing could be further from the truth. As I made my inquiries, I discovered that, prior to the exodus, Bozjan merchants had established a trading presence in the Dravanian hinterlands. Indeed, it was these merchants who brought the Ixal to their knees.\nIt was these humble beginnings, however, that eventually led to the decline of the Ixal and the expulsion of their ancestors from the region. It is for this reason that some believe the arrival of the Warrior of Light to be a manifestation of the will of the Dravanians, and not simply the will of a few isolated tribes.\nBut to question the motives of a handful of ancient Bozjan merchants is simply beside the point. What is important is the purpose for which they came to Limsa Lominsa in the first place.\nAnd that purpose was to trade. Simply put, my research has uncovered the truth about the exodus, and if you would allow me to explain what that research means for your own life, I am certain that you would be more than satisfied.", '\nMarielle:', '\nAh, I knew I could count on you.

Having you at the helm means you have taken the first step along the path to attaining your dream.\nNow it is up to you to take the next one. There is still much to be done, and your assistance is more than welcome.\nPlease speak with me again at Palaka's Stand to receive your reward.\nOh, and if you desire any other gift, I would be honored if you could return to my side.']

Title: A Blissful Arrival
Dialogue: ['\nBraya:', '\nWelcome, sir, to the Skysteel Manufactory!\nYou are perhaps wondering who might be interested in your work. Well, I am! I have the honor of being the first person from the factory to receive an apprenticeship.\nNot long ago, I received a letter from a young artisan who desires my assistance in finding his perfect piece. The young man writes that he has need of a talented individual to assist him in finding his dream piece.\nHe requests that I travel to the Sapphire Avenue Exchange in the South Shroud and speak with a man named Rowena.\nRowena is an accomplished alchemist who has her hands full preparing the ingredients needed to create all manner of wondrous potions. I am certain she can assist you in this endeavor.\nOh, and before you go, I must ask that you provide me with your vision! Do you believe that your crafted wares will bring happiness to the world?', '\nRowena:', "\nAh, Forename Surname! I take it Rowena has been expecting you.\nI am pleased to say that she has a fine selection of wares to choose from─everything from fine jewelry to simple tableware. If there is something you fancy, you may be sure to browse her wares!\nIf you would have any further questions, I would be happy to answer them.

I gather the young artisan was quite impressed with your wares!\nI must say, I've never seen such refined and beautiful crystals before! The work you have done here is truly remarkable. I cannot wait to get back to my workshop and give you your commissions!\nI was especially impressed with one of your pieces, the brooch you crafted. Not only is it well-crafted, but the design is truly exquisite!\nAs an alchemist, it is my responsibility to ensure that all of the materials used in our work are of the utmost quality. That is why I was so excited to receive this letter.\nIf Rowena has any advice for you, I would be happy to hear it!

Title: A Blissful Arrival
Dialogue: ['\nAlisaie:', "\nWelcome to the Quicksand, friend. If there's one thing I've learned about the Quicksand over the years, it's that moogles love a good adventure.\nThat's why I was so eager to find you─and why I'm more than a little bit flustered, if you'll excuse the phrase. Anyway, what I'd really like is for you to take this ampoule of sweet perfume and sprinkle it about the place where you meet Moghome. Moghome's the big, bad, mad Moghome, so I don't trust myself around that bloke. Not that it's a crime to throw a fragrant aromatic over your head, of course...\nThe ampoule will keep the scent from lingering and, best of all, it won't sting your clothes like the stuff that Moghome's been known to spit! Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a test to perform...", '\nMoghan:', "\nOh, hello there....Oh, hello there...\n...What's that? You have an ampoule of sweet perfume? Moghan is so funny, she makes me smell good like that!...Well, no, I wouldn't expect you to smell so good, Moghan. It's just... I've never had an ampoule of that strength before.\nOh, but it's so lovely, I'm sure you'll be wanting more! Why didn't you say so sooner? I can't wait to try it out!", '\nMoghan:', "\nI can't wait to try out the ampoule of sweet perfume! Why didn't you say so sooner? I can't wait to try it out!", '\nAlisaie:', "\nOh, I didn't see you there. I hope you didn't run into any trouble.\nAs I said, Moghome's the big, bad, mad Moghome, so any fragrant that might sting you will do so with greater ease.\nI don't know about you two, but I'm sure that an ampoule of that strength would be the talk of the town once the servants have finished sweeping the floor.\nSpeaking of which, I'm sure they'll be wanting for cleaning supplies. That's why I was so keen to see you come─I can't wait to see what you'll be able to bring back to us.", '\nMoghan:', "\nAh, it's been so long since I've had an ampoule of that strength....What? You're looking for the perfume, then? Don't tell me!...Well, no, I wouldn't expect you to smell so good, Moghan. It's just... I've never had an ampoule of that strength before.\nOh, but it's so lovely, I'm sure you'll be wanting more! Why didn't you say so sooner? I can't wait to try it out!", '\nAlisaie:', "\nSo you're the adventurer from Eulmore, then. I didn't think you'd be back so soon...", '\nMoghan:', "\nAh, you found the perfume, didn't you?
