Though I am not certain if they were all of the same strain, or if there were more than one, each with their own unique talents.\nWhile we cannot offer much, we can provide you with assistance in gathering supplies as well. I would ask you search for pockets of scholars in the North Shroud, just beyond the bridge to the west.\nThe Scholar is presently under attack, but we cannot spare any more men to assist in defending the structure.
