I'm glad to have you on my side.\nI'm asking you for one more favor, though. Please take this as payment for your troubles. I'm sure you know what it is.\nA lot of folk make a killing selling sin eaters. It's a pretty simple thing, really. Just lay the carcasses out along the road, and whoever comes across 'em gets a nice cut of the action.\nIt might not seem like much at first, but these sorts of things accumulate in the wrong hands. I don't care if you kill a hundred or a thousand sin
