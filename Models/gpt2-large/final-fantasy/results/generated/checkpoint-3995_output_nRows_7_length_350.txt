Given the difficulties which have beset our efforts to date, I should think it only appropriate that the Alliance leaders meet here, not far from the front lines.\nI am pleased to say that the selection was made not only due to their leadership roles, but also because of their leadership roles within the Resistance.\nYou may have heard, but we have striven tirelessly to create an environment in which all could live and work in peace. And thanks to the efforts of both our Houses, we are close to achieving that aim.\
