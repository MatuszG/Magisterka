Dialogue: ['\nLucinne:', "\n'Twas on the eve of the Battle of Carteneau, nigh on five years ago. I was a field marshal at the time, and had the honor of watching the Allied forces march into the enemy's stronghold. It was then that I knew for certain that the Empire was defeated─and I have since been confirmed in that belief.\nBut then, all of a sudden, I received word that the Empire's forces were massing for an attack on the Lancers' Guild. I knew nothing of the threat, but I knew my men. I ordered them to stand down and return to their posts, but they refused. They went on strike, and for the next several weeks we did not hear word of any Allied forces crossing the line.\nI had thought that perhaps the Lancers' Guild had been overrun by the Empire, but I was wrong. The assault on the headquarters had been led by a unit of the IIIrd Legion under the command of Garlemald.\nI sent word to the 1st Unit, but they had already marched on to the scene of the crime. They were nowhere in sight, and I could not fathom why they had not returned. When I learned of the incident later, it came to me: perhaps they had been conscripted by the Empire and forced to march in the attack on the Lancers' Guild.\nBut who could have taken command of the IIIrd Legion at a time such as this? I knew not of the incident, but I suspected that it might have been one of my subordinates. I dispatched a message to my superior, but he had already returned.\nThe question of who could have taken command of the IIIrd Legion at a time such as this remains unanswered. It may be that my men were not conscripted by the Empire, but that they took command in the Garlemald assault is, at the very least, undeniable.\nBut there is more. At the time of the assault, General Ran'jit was commanding the IIIrd Legion's forces in the East. General Ran'jit has since been transferred to the 1st, but I have not been able to contact him in quite some time.\nCould it be that he has fallen sick? It would be a serious blow to the morale of the 1st, but I cannot imagine he would refuse to take up the war effort. I will consider placing a call to him, but in the meantime, I would ask that you seek him out at the Adders' Nest.\nGeneral Ran'jit is currently at the Adders' Nest in the East. I would ask that you seek him out there.", '\nRanjit:', "\nAh, the young one returns─though I should not mistake him for the older. The one I have been expecting, you say?\nIt is good to see you again, Forename. It would not do to keep the young one waiting.\nYou have heard the reports, yes? I would not pretend otherwise.\nI have not forgotten the day the Garleans attacked. Five years on, and with naught but our words to guide us, we are all too prone to exaggeration.\nBut we are not fools. We know that the Garleans have grown stronger, that they seek to call down their gods once more.\nFor the sake of the 1st, I would ask that you do all in your power to convince the people of Ishgard that the gods have once more been summoned.\nThat will be all, General Ran'jit.", '\nLucinne:', "\nIt has been some time since you have spoken with General Ran'jit.

Though he makes do with what he has, he is constantly at a loss as to what to do.\nUltimately, in the end, he decides to make his father's instrument his own, and begins playing with all his heart. The tune he scores is a tribute to his son, who he dearly loves.\nI am certain you must be eager to hear the tale in its entirety. I would have you start with the first verse. It goes like this:\n“My father was a craftsman of the Rakuza Trading Company,\nmaking utensils and other such trifling utensils for all who come to the port of Kugane.\nWhen I heard that my son was playing with such fervor, I was filled with pride, knowing that I had made a fine contribution to the development of music in my homeland.\nHowever, gods forbid that I should ever have to witness my son's development in person. I could only imagine the look on my mother's face as I recounted the tale to her.\nThankfully, you have more than made up your mind about the matter. If you wish to hear the rest, I would be honored if you could place your trust in me again.\nI thank you, Forename. Ever shall I cherish the memory of our precious exchange."]

Yet, I cannot help but wonder─why do some folk seem to prefer the sounds of the ancients to those of us who hail from the same land?\nI can only assume that it has something to do with the way that they were created. For instance, did you know that the “old ways” of music were in fact a way of life? It is said that, “when the Twelveswood was still untamed, “the “old ways” were passed down through the generations.\nPerhaps that is why some feel that the sounds of the ancients are somehow...less pleasing.

Dialogue: ['\nTaciturn Temple Knight:', "I take it you've heard the tales, yes? Of course you have─the Temple Knights of Limsa Lominsa pride ourselves on our martial prowess. And though our records show only a handful of our knights ever reaching the pinnacle of their art, it doesn't take an expert to recognize the value of a well-trained soldier. I would be most grateful if you would accept my humble offering of a new instrument. I've been in a dour mood ever since Master Gerolt informed me of the passing of his mentor, and I dare not show my face in the barracks until he's returned...for now. But on the off chance a Temple Knight of your esteemed pedigree happens to walk through the doors, pray convey my heartfelt thanks to him in the most heartfelt of ways. In the meantime, I suggest you seek out my friend Aedoc in the Acorn Orchard, behind the barracks. He should have something ready for you.", '\nAedoc:', "Welcome, paladin of the Temple Knights of Limsa Lominsa. I am Aedoc, and like all of the other instructors I am charged with keeping the poor and the dispossessed safe and sound. That being said, I would be lying if I said more men under my command don't go above and beyond the call of duty. And I can tell you're eager to make the acquaintance of one who's trained in the techniques of both the Temple Knights and the Imperials─Master Gerolt Blackthorne, no doubt. Oh, and before you ask, I don't keep a journal. It's not that I don't think there's value to it─far from it─but rather that it's just not my thing. I suspect you've already guessed as much. Suffice it to say, if there's anything I can do for you, you'll be hearing from me."]

There's nothing to it!\nYou might be wondering why we'd even bother with a spoon if it's so simple. Well, the history of our people is quite messy.\nWe once used to grind the shells of kobolds into a fine powder. Then, when we needed to craft another horn, we simply tossed the powder into a fire and waited for it to boil.\nThat's why a wooden spoon is so important─it gives us the opportunity to create something of the past, something that we can hold on to and cherish.\nThat's why I was so pleased when you agreed to help me. Not only are you kind, but you've proven to be quite reliable as well. I can't thank you enough, Forename."]

I have been expecting you, Forename, and I am exceedingly pleased to see you!\nI have been working on a report of late, and it would be no exaggeration to say that it is one of the most important I have ever penned. If I could share the details with you, it would be my sincerest thanks!\nThe Ala Mhigan Resistance, as I have since dubbed them, was created to combat the Empire's forces. Their first foray into Garlemald was a success, prompting the government to request additional troops.\nHowever, after a number of failures, they were forced to scale back their operations.\nI had hoped that shifting their focus from Garlemald to Doma would be a step in the right direction, but it appears they are instead taking their talents to Ul'dah.\nWhile I am not at liberty to divulge their current objectives, I can say with certainty that Ala Mhigan will not be going down without a fight.\nI can only imagine the bloodshed that awaits the people of Doma should the Resistance triumph...\nWell, I cannot wait to see you and the Resistance fighters upon the field of battle!

I knew I could count on you, Forename.\nDoma and Ul'dah both stand at the precipice of ruin. Should the Empire fall, the ashes will be swept away and new life breathed into the land.\nTo be sure, we cannot allow that to happen.\nEven though the Resistance is a part of Doma, our ties to the homeland are not so easily forged.\nI have heard it said that Ala Mhigo is a place where brothers fight side by side, and that is certainly the case here.\nBrothers and sisters fight for the freedom of Ala Mhigo, and we will not let the Empire take that liberty from us.\nNot that I would want it that way─I would not be Ala Mhigo's first lady!\nNo, my report must be delivered to Mururu, the leader of the Resistance in Ala Mhigo.\nYour task is thus clear: go to Mururu and deliver the report to her.\nGood luck, Forename! Keep up the good work!", '\nMururu:', "Greetings, sir. What brings you to Ala Mhigo?\nAh, the Ala Mhigan Resistance report. It is from Commander Luciane. As I expected, the Garleans made short work of Ala Mhigo.\nThough I expected the Resistance to have a greater presence in the city, I had no idea they would take the field so openly. \nThis is indeed a worrying development, and we must take all necessary precautions.\nBut I should not be surprised if trouble comes our way.\nThe Ala Mhigans are a proud people, and pride themselves on seeing their fellow Ala Mhigans live up to their names.\nIf any among them turn against us, we will be forced to take up arms again─and sooner rather than later.\nThat is why I wanted the Ala Mhigan Resistance to have a presence in Doma.\nIf they mean to take the city, they will need our

You've been out for quite a while─what with those blasted dragons and all─so I'm glad to see you're still in one piece.\nThe problem you had with the dragons is something that's rather easy to spot.

As a matter of fact, some of the best craftsmen in Ishgard are thought to be involved in the making of these horrible weapons.\nThe problem is, however, that the quality of these weapons is so awful, that even the best of soldiers can't be trusted to use them effectively.\nIn fact, one of my subordinates, Ser Aymeric, was recently tasked with assessing the quality of the dragon-made weapons he was sent to collect. His report is due back from the manufactory in Longmirror Lake.\nI would have you deliver the report to him. It's just a bit of a detour, but he's likely waiting for it at the manufactory.", '\nAymeric:', "\n...What's this? A report from the manufactory? What's this?\n...Dragon-made?

You've got something for me, you say?\n...In my opinion, the quality of these dragon-made weapons is among the worst I've ever seen.\nIf the Ishgardians are to be believed, the weapons' owner─or rather, his procurement agent─was a heretic. In fact, I can think of no one more suited to such a role.\nA heretic in the name of Haldrath, the archbishop of Ishgard! This is a most grave matter.\nWell, I'll not pretend I'm not worried.
