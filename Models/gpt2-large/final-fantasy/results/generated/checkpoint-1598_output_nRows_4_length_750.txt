Not unlike the rest of the instruments I've seen.\nBut I digress. Here is a little something from my personal collection.\nIt's a piece of brass, with a handle made of dragon bone. Inscribed on it are the names of several of the guildmaster's pupils, the first of whom was born before the Calamity.\nAfter he left, I think he came back and found his way to the capital. He likely made his way to the Black Shroud, since that's where the Calamity took place.\nAnd since then, the Brass Blades have been operating under the protection of the Brass Knights, who are the closest thing the Order of the Twin Adder has to a military.\nBut I don't believe that Garlemald is involved in the Brass Blades' operations.
