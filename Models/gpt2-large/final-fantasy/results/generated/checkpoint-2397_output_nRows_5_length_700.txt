Dialogue: ['\nPrairillot:', "That which the ancients called “the hammer of Ra” was in fact a type of bronze hammer. The name itself is of uncertain origin, but it is most likely the product of an attempt to adapt the weapon of the ancients to the needs of our time.\nThe hammer was employed in the hands of smiths of great renown throughout the known world, and it is said that one of their greatest creations was the “Hammer of Ra” found at Thal's Respite, in southern Thanalan.\nIn ancient days, the ancients did not simply craft their weapons from clay and clay alone, but rather employed a variety of techniques to enhance the properties of their materials.\nIt is said that the techniques employed by the ancients were so comprehensive that they were able to craft weapons that were wholly unique to themselves.\nThe hammer of Ra was said to possess such destructive potential, and it was coveted by great warriors of all lands. Indeed, it was coveted as a weapon of the ancients, and it is said that it was wielded by the first Azure Dragoon.\nUnfortunately, in the aftermath of the Calamity, its creator was unable to locate the time and resources to complete his work.\nUpon learning of this, the Azure Dragoon turned to me for assistance, and I have been working with our guild ever since.\nMy efforts to recreate the hammer of Ra have garnered considerable attention from both the ancients and the outsiders, and I am confident that we will have a weapon of incomparable quality once we have mastered the techniques employed by its original creator.\nI thank you for your assistance, Forename.\nI am pleased to say that the hammer of Ra is ready for its first use. When placed in the hands of the wielder, its destructive potential is unleashed in the form of a thunderous explosion.\nWith your help, I am confident that we will have a weapon of incomparable quality once we have mastered the techniques employed by its original creator.\nYou have my sincerest gratitude.\n"]
