I am not familiar with the term, but “artisan” is apparently not one of them.\nI suppose your interest is piqued, for 'artisan” is indeed the common term. In my native France, the term was used to refer to a person who specialized in one particular craft.\nIn my native village, such knowledge as was possessed by the “artisan” was exhibited in the form of musical instruments. I can tell you now, however, that such knowledge was not to be shared.\nThe village elders felt that music was a simple and unadorned art, unworthy of respect. Hence, they did not allow their children to learn it.\nBut I am unsure of the reason for your visit. Perhaps you wish to discuss matters of import elsewhere? Ah, but of course─I can provide you with a place to meet the villagers!\nIf you would like to pay your respects to the departed, go to the Matron's Letheanum at Revenant's Toll. I will await you there.", '\nHugubert:', 'Welcome back. I trust you were able to find the villagers?\nWonderful. Here is where I will show you the way.\nThe Matron's Letheanum is where the souls of the deceased are gathered. The stone is covered in glyphs of the Twelve that are sacred to our goddess. It is from this place that the souls are chosen to journey the next life.\nWhen one of our people has died, they are entombed within the stone for a time. This is so that they may continue to journey the next life, as the Matron has commanded.\nNow then, allow me to tell you more about this place. The glyphs upon the stone are of the Twelve, and each one is engraved with a memory of the person they represent.\nYou will soon come to understand why the elders deem it so important that you learn the art of music. In the meantime, I would ask that you seek out the matron yourself.']

Dialogue: ['\nTataru:', "\nWell met, adventurer. I'm Tataru, conductor of the Ok' Gundu.\nI take it you wish to join me. I am flattered that you would come all this way to hear me prattle on and on...\nBut then you must be curious to know how I can so coolly direct you to the magnificent instrument I have destined for your use. Ahem.\nIt is my sincerest hope that you will be impressed with the fine instrument I have chosen for you to play. I mean to perform an offering to the gods in the form of a sacred melody.\nA melody that will inspire all within and bring them together to a shared experience that transcends time and space. A melody that will bring joy to all regardless of differences such as race and creed. A melody that will bring people together regardless of differences such as nation and creed.\nThis instrument is of the utmost importance to me. It is not a toy I make lightly, nor is it a piece I make with a single piece of filament. I would not have allowed you to play it had I not thought it worthy.\nIt is said that the first string of a gonga is blessed by Nymeia, keeper of the winds. This instrument is sacred to Hraesvelgr, guardian deity of the gonga.\nI am humbled to admit that I have no idea what string the gonga will be tuned to. But I am confident I will receive the necessary guidance from my superiors.\nIn the meantime, I have prepared a melody that will serve as your starting point. Pray play it to the gods and let them hear the sound of your heart.\nI am certain that once you have learned the tune, you will find it as easy to play as it is to sing. As your instrument grows, so shall your skills grow as well.\nSo you see, the journey into the heart of the Hraesvelgr forest begins with a melody. If you would know more, pray play my melody to the gods again and again, until your playing has become as natural to you as the sounds you hear around you.\nWhen your playing has become as refined as it is here, then you will have reached the pinnacle of an instrument's capabilities.\nIf you desire to
