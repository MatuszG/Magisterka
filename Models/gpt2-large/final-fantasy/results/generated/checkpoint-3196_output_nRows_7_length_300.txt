Dialogue: ['\nDadanen:', '\nAs you have doubtless noticed, the markets are rather...damp. As a merchant, it is my duty to stay abreast of market trends, but I am also keenly aware of the opportunities that may lie ahead.\nFor example, I recently chanced to spot a rather unusual item at the market─a piece of artillery from the Allied forces. I asked around and was told it was taken from a Maelstrom soldier.\nSoldiers are not wont to leave behind their weapons, but the fact that this particular piece was left behind is curious indeed. I wonder if the soldier was planning to keep it and put it to good use.\nRegardless, as a merchant, it is my duty to make sure that my customers are satisfied. And considering the sensitive nature of this weapon, I daresay I could do a better job of that.\nSo I turned to you. I would be ever so grateful if you could take this piece and place it in a suitable location on the map.\nI will mark it down in East Hawkers' Alley, just behind the counter. Remember to put the location in the notes to the customer─I will not be able to tell them which is which.', '\nPop:', '\nYou sense a hostile presence!', '\nDadanen:', '\n
