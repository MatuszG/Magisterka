I can only assume that you are well acquainted with materia.\nMateria is a magical substance often used to enhance weapons and armor. The amount of materia required to attune a weapon and armor is known as their respective crafting disciplines.\nFor example, the disciplines of Arms and Magic allow for the creation of arms and armor with greater strength and a higher degree of durability.\nIn contrast, the disciplines of Wood and Earth allow for the creation of sturdier and more vulnerable armaments. It is these differences that allow one discipline to dominate the field.\nToday, we are teaching you the differences between these two, but I imagine you will want to experiment with your own creations before making your decision.\nBefore we continue, however, there is something I would ask of you.\nDo you believe that a weapon and armor created with materia have a greater potential to inflict damage?\nIf so, what manner of weapon and armor would you most like to see?\nI am aware that certain techniques are best employed when in a battle state. It may behoove you to experiment with your weapons and armaments before making a decision.\nPlease return to your lessons and continue your training. You have much to learn."]

Title: A Bold Decision
Dialogue: ['\nBraya:', '\nWelcome back, Forename! I trust you have learned a valuable lesson from this experience.\nIn your haste to seek out the counsel of the Twelve, you have undoubtedly been drawn into disputes that could have been settled with a simple yes or no.\nBut such decisions are best made with the utmost deliberation, for a party is only as good as the number of decisions it makes.\nTo help you on your way, I shall give you the tools you need to become more efficient at decision-making.\nMake your way to the Octant and speak with Sister Eluned. She will be happy to set your feet on the right path.\nWhen you have finished speaking with her, return to me. I will have something for you to consider.\n', '\nEluned:', '\nWell met, Forename! I take it you have decided to become a monk.\nBy your swift action, you have already proven yourself more than a simple yes or no. I am proud to call you brother.\nBut let us speak of your decision-making process. When I asked Brother Braya what he had in mind, he told me that it was best if you spoke with me first.\nSo, what did you think of his suggestion?\nI see... It was certainly not a simple yes or no. But let us speak of the decision itself.\nThe path of the bard is not an easy one. One must weigh the many benefits of a monastic life against the hardships of not following one's heart.\nBut never forget that you are a bard─there is no substitute for experience. And with such lessons as these as you have received, I should hope you will have them.\nWhen next you meet Sister Eluned, pray reflect on the lessons you have learned. You are my only hope for success!']

Title: A Bold Decision
Dialogue: ['\nY'shtola:', '\nI am loath to send you into the midst of danger again so soon, but we must.\nYou see, the other day one of our new recruits was poisoned by a sylph. The poison is a virulent strain, and it is only a matter of time before it finishes the job.\nIt would be a terrible start to lose one of our newest members of the Company. I would ask you to travel to the poison-ridden area and treat him. Once he is well, see to it he is properly reinforced.\nIf you are willing, pray travel to the poison-ridden area and treat one of our new recruits. Once he is well, see to it he is properly reinforced.', '\nWounded Recruit (Wherever You May Be):', "\nBloody hells... You saved my life! Thank the Twelve, thank the Twelve! You are too kind, too kind. I'm a mess, I'm a mess. But you're going to help me, are you not?\nYou saved my life, and I owe you my life. I was a mess before you came along, but now I'm a lot more clear-headed. I can take care of myself. Thank you for helping me."]
