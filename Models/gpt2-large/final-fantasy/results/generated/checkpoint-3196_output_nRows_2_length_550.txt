It's one o' the greatest comebacks I've ever witnessed, a tale of derring-do and gallantry that will be immortalized in the annals of history.\nA veteran of countless battles, the Bard had earned the right to call himself a bard in the eyes of many. Yet for all his accomplishments, the commonfolk had naught but scorn for him.\nIt's a sentiment that grows more fervent with each passing day, aye. Even as we speak, countless Ala Mhigans are without a voice, a situation I can only imagine.\nThis land, where once the glories of Ishgard were sung in the sun, now teems with the unruly. An unruly lot, I might add, when pitted against a people so woeful in their numbers.\nNo matter how much the gods might wish to see this nation restored to its former glory, they cannot soothe the unruly. I fear that unless the bard restores the people's faith in him, they will turn against him in droves.\nHe must needs prove to the people that he is a bard worthy of their trust, and that his tales are true. If he can do this, then every Ala Mhigan that has ever loved him will come to know the truth─and if he tells them true, then every Ala Mhigan that has ever known him will know the truth, and so on, forever and ever.\nI implore you, Forename─speak to the people in my village, and hear with your own

A man who helped bring about the golden age of Eorzea, if you will.\nAfter he retired, he devoted his time to his research, eventually turning his attentions to the creation of new potions to aid the sick and wounded.\nI had the honor of being introduced to him by one of our predecessors, when he was still at the helm of the Company.

There was no denying that he was a great alchemist, and one of the finest of our time, if not longer.\nIt would have been a shame to see him retire, but I understand that it was for the best.
