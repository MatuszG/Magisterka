Dialogue: ['\nWyrnzoen:', "\nAh, Forename. I take it you've heard about the new bonds we've established with our allies, the sylphs.\nThough I imagine you've already heard the tall tale, the truth is a bit more exciting.\nI speak of the “Bribery Bond,” a special arrangement we've forged with the sylphs in exchange for exclusive rights to hunt certain creatures in our territory.\nThe agreement is truly unprecedented─and I do mean unprecedented.\nThe sylphs are not accustomed to being the object of mortal desire. In fact, they're rather reticent to even approach men─much less offer their bodies for sport.\nBut as long as we maintain a healthy relationship with them, they won't grow too resentful. And that's the least they can do, after all they're essentially begging us to do.\nAs a token of our gratitude, we've agreed to share information with our allies─primarily the sylphs living in the North Shroud.\nThe sylphs living in the North Shroud have been receptive to our requests, but they insist on their own way of expressing their gratitude, which is why I've asked Frondale to provide you with a token of our appreciation.\nAs agreed, Frondale will deliver this to the sylphs living in the South Shroud.\nI'm sure you remember the way in which the sylphs used to greet you when you first came to Gridania, but I imagine they've changed somewhat in recent memory.\nI imagine they'll greet you in a more welcoming manner now that you've introduced yourself. Should you continue to patronize the sylphs in your heart, I daresay they'll welcome you back as well.\nI should mention, however, that the sylphs living in the South Shroud are a different breed altogether. They're quite intelligent, but they're also quite shy.\nThey may treat you as a mere acquaintance, but you'll quickly learn their ways and adapt to your ways as well.\nIn short, if you want to get to know the sylphs, you'd best strike up a friendly relationship with them first.\nIf you'd like to learn more about the bonds we've established with our sylph allies, I suggest you speak with Frondale at Palaka's Stand before departing for the North Shroud.", '\nFrondale:', '\nWelcome back, Forename! Here is your token of our appreciation.\nThe sylphs have been incredibly helpful in sharing information with us, which is why I feel it's important we learn more of their culture and preferences.\nThat said, they do have one request which I'm sure you can accommodate.\nThey would like you to hunt certain creatures in our territory. I'm not sure what they're expecting, but I would be honored if you agreed to do so.\nI would also strongly advise against associating with the sylphs in the first place, as they are rather reticent to associating with anyone at all.\nBut never you mind that! What do you say to hunting the sylphs in our territory?', '\nPop:', '\nYou sense a hostile presence!', '\nAccess:', '\nThe enemy is still about!', '\nFrondale:', '\nHow goes the hunt? Any

You are an outsider, yes?', '\nBeneger:', "\nI knew I could count on you!\nI would ask you to go to Iron Lake and fetch some provisions for my men.\nIt is not far─due east of here.

It couldn't be further from the truth.\nI would sooner die than become a party to any more of their charade. I would rather die with my dignity intact, but if you insist...\nThank you for bringing me these logs.

Dialogue: ['\nQeshiraz:', "\nI am loath to trouble you again, but I fear that my earlier chiding has left a sour taste in your mouth. I fear that you have forgotten the fruits of my instruction. Allow me to repeat: the path to attaining nirvana is a long and arduous one.\nEven the staunchest of warriors─the finest of the Qestir─cannot hope to conquer the heavens. Yet, should they choose to forsake their training in favor of adventuring, they would be doomed to fail.\nTo overcome such a daunting prospect, they must be as nimble and agile as possible. To this end, I have constructed a simple device that will allow them to soar the skies nimbly.\nThough it is crude in design, the device is nevertheless effective.

I pray that it serves to motivate them to keep practicing.\nLastly, I would like you to have this. As promised, I will explain the nature of nirvana to you, and how it is attained.\nBefore I do so, however, I must ask that you make a vow to dedicate yourself to the pursuit of nirvana.\nOnly by doing so will you be able to ensure that you─and only you─can realize your dream.\nI trust that you are aware of what this means? A lifetime of training, followed by a single sleepless night? Hardly an ideal arrangement.\nWell, if you wish to hear me speak of it, then allow me to repeat: a lifetime of training, followed by a single sleepless night. Not an ideal arrangement, I concede, but one which has been remarkably successful for me.\nNow, as you are doubtless aware, aether permeates all things in our world. It is a vital ingredient for life, and it is essential to our well-being─a fact that has been profoundly changed by the Qestir's intrusion.\nIn order to commune with the aether, the Qestir have been forced to train in a manner that is nigh-infinite in its depth.\nIn order to maintain their physical and mental well-being, they have been forced to train in a manner that is nigh-infinite in its depth.\nTo make matters worse, they have been subjected to grueling drills that pit them against unfathomably difficult opponents.\nThough they would never admit it, many of them are beginning to believe that their hardships are somehow their own fault.\nTo be sure, there is much that they do not know, and which I would freely grant them

Unable to bear the burden alone, he entrusted his successor with his legacy.

Together, and not to be broken by the past.\nFor a time he lived a lie, but in the end he accepted the reality of what had become of him. He chose to see it not as an insurmountable obstacle, but a source of strength.\nHe asked that you journey to the ruins with him, that you might tell him the truth in his mind. He knew that if you could, you would succeed where he failed.\nSo I will accompany you, that you might do what I cannot. We must make haste to Voeburt! I will join you as soon as I have finished my research.\nOh, and before I forget─here is your very own axe!", '\nGalfrid:', "\nYou'll find Galfrid in the study to the east.

Though he fought through it, it eventually claimed his life.\nNot long ago, I left his side and went to tend to my research. Though I was devastated to lose him, I know that he would have wanted me to carry on his work.\nThough we have both suffered greatly, it is our duty to try and make the world a better place. To that end, we must strive to find a cure for Galfrid's illness

You should be aware that, unlike the syrictae, the brutes that prowl the area are not wont to attack travelers.\nBe warned, however, that they are not wont to wait for their prey to come to them. If you should make a mistake, you may be faced with a hungry predator on your own.\nMy men will explain the situation to you once we arrive.

I trust you were able to dispatch the brutes as I asked?\nVery good. I knew I could count on you.\nThe syrictae are a common sight in Gridania, but I never thought I'd have to see one in the flesh.\nThey are a very dangerous lot, to be sure, but it would be a waste to send them out to slaughter more of the same. It would be better if we reduced them to rubble so that fewer of their kind make a living.\nThat is why we are here. To help us do that, we must put down the more dangerous brutes. It is not easy work, to be sure, but we do it because it is what we do."]
