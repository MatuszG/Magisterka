Dialogue: ['\nU'odh Nunh:', "It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance. I am U'odh Nunh, researcher and curator of the artifacts in this room.\nMy work has always been concerned with the creation of artworks that are both aesthetically pleasing and physically robust. I have been working on a new prototype of an instrument that I would like you to play for me.\nI have no doubt that you will find it quite engaging.\nNow, if you would allow me to explain the workings of the device, I will share with you some of the data that I have collected during my work with it.\nThe device in question is a “glock.” It is a type of firearm originally designed to inflict wounds upon creatures, but its function has since expanded to include enhancing arms and armor.\nIt is my hope that this new instrument will prove as useful to you as my earlier work has.\nIt should, of course, be noted that this device is still in its prototype phase, and it is entirely possible that it will undergo further adjustments before its official release.\nSo, what say you? Are you willing to try it for yourself?", '\nU'odh Nunh:', "I am afraid I cannot promise that you will succeed, but if you try, I will personally evaluate your performance.\nIf you are willing to try it for yourself, I suggest you begin by placing your glock in the holster on your person.\nYou should feel comfortable adjusting the firearm's grip until you feel comfortable holding it with both hands.", '\nU'odh Nunh:', "You should feel comfortable adjusting the firearm's grip until you feel comfortable holding it with both hands.", '\nU'odh Nunh:', "Now, as you can see, the glock is a rather crude device.
