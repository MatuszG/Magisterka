Dialogue: ['\nEthelred:', "\nYou there, traveler! What's that you have there? I'm sure you're wondering why I'm here.\nWell, it's for a very special reason, which I'll let you find out once you've a look at that instrument you call a “blessing.” It's my father's relic, and it's been passed down through the generations.\nWe all know the value of a relic, but there's no one here who knows how to appraise it, which is why I decided to collect some samples myself. I'm sure you're eager to see what they've got to offer, so let's start by taking a look at the blade itself.\n...What's this? It's a bit harder than I'd like, but I can't imagine you've got much better than this.\nAye, it's quite beautiful. I'm sure the blade was made with great care─maybe even a bit of heat.\nYou'll notice that the patina's gone through some slight change, but it still looks like it was made by an artisan with a passion for quality.\nThe pommel, on the other hand, is surprisingly un-crystalline. The reason for that is probably that it was painted by a master carpenter, who's passed down the knowledge of his craft to his apprentices.\nBut let's talk about the blade itself. I've seen worse, but this is nothing short of a masterpiece.\nYou know, it's hard to believe that I actually have a father still living─or even that he's a relic himself. Even so, he was a good man.\nIn any case, it's a pity that he wasn't here to see his work brought to light. I'm sure he'd be thrilled to see the relic in its new home.\nIf you've got any further questions, I can answer them for you."]
