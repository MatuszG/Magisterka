The only person who could succeed him was his closest ally, the Warrior of Light.\nBut the time had come for the two tribes to band together and put an end to the craven leader and restore the honor of the Vundu. I believe you can help make this happen. I would ask you to travel to Vundu Dzemael and offer him my sword.\nHe is in a pitiful position. The entire village is under the control of a band of Vundu who seek to purge the village of all who do not agree with their views.

Why would anyone part with such a valuable treasure?\nTo find out, you must first know the truth behind the Steel Vigil.\nHah, I knew you would come! Aye, I knew you would come! The truth behind the Steel Vigil lies in this chest.\nThis chest contains an ancient amaro skull, which the pirates gave to the soldiers upon their arrival at the Steel Vigil.\nAlas, the amaro were wont to hunt not only the mammets that roamed the plains, but also any beasts that came within sight of the Vigil itself.\nThe Skull of the Valued Warrior, as it is called, is said to be one of these prized artifacts. When the pirates found it, they were so eager to show it to their comrades, they damaged the machinery within without taking the time to repair it.\nAnd so, the Steel Vigil is a monument to their treachery. Its very existence has ensured that those within its walls are wary of approaching.\nI know not how you will fare in the Coliseum against the likes of me, but do not let your guard down. Remember: the pirates were desperate to show the skull to their comrades, and damaged the machinery within without taking the proper measures.", '\nPop:', '\nYou sense a hostile presence!', '\nWawalago:', '\nDid you find the amaro skull?

A hidden path, perhaps?\nA path that leads to the ruins of Pharos Sirius, perhaps?\nAhahaha! I jest, of course. There is no truth to these whispers.\nBut that is not to say that the rumors are not true. I did meet with a man named A'aba, and he told me of a path that leads from Pharos Sirius to the ruins of Pharos Magna.\n...A path that leads from Pharos Sirius to the ruins of Pharos Magna.\nThe ruins of Pharos Sirius is said to be the resting place of the first king of the Amaro, who united the tribes under his rule.\nAnd when he died, his soul descended into the ruins, and there he hid the Skull of the Valued Warrior, which has since become the symbol of his rule.\nHe hid it so well that even after he was ousted, it was not until centuries after his death that the thieves managed to take it.\nAnd that is why you must go and find it. It is not safe for you to remain here, and you would not survive long in my company. Take the path and find the treasure, for you will need it when you are able to return to the Steel Vigil."]
