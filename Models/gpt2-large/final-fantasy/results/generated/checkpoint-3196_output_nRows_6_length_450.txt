Dialogue: ['\nHugubert:', "Well met, adventurer. I'm Hugubert, a merchant who's traveled to every corner of the realm to find the best wares for my customers.\nWhen I'm not busy peddling my wares, I'm usually up to my eyeballs in coin─or in this case, gil─peddling my knowledge of monster fangs and poison.\nBut I've a mind to settle down here in peace, and that means I've got to find a decent, if unspectacular, hunting dog.\nAnd I can't possibly hunt a beast with my current skills.\nI'd heard a man named Dyrstweitz had found a pup that's taken to killing everything in sight. If anyone can get this pup a proper home, though, I reckon it'd be him.\nI'd give you a call and see if he'd be willing to take in this pup, but I'm afraid he's off on another hunt. Might you go in my stead?", '\nDyrstweitz:', "Aye, I'm Dyrstweitz. Bounty hunter by trade, mostly sin eaters.\nOne of my more recent clients has a pet wolf that's taken to gnawing on his adversaries. Needless to say, I'm not keen on having the poor thing around.\nI'd be grateful if you could bring him a new dog. I've one under control at the moment, but as this is my first time breeding a dog, I'm sure I'll make mistakes.\nAnd if any of that gets stuck going down, you can be the one to call. Just give me the name of the pup, and I'll see you're duly compensated for your services."]

The Salt Strand, southwest of Scorpion Crossing; The Octant, northwest of Scorpion Crossing; or the Lost Land, northwest of Scorpion Crossing.\nI'll be waiting for you all at the Lost Land, so if you need to return to Centurio, you can use that standard to signal for an Ironworks airship.

Or...maybe it's simply...\nI can't say for sure, but I suspect it's the former. It's clear that this crystal is vital to that creature, and protecting it is paramount

Dialogue: ['\nGildon:', "I've seen you before─Forename, was it?\nI'm a researcher here, and I've been tasked with studying the fauna of Costa del Sol.\nAnd I've come to a rather interesting discovery. Something about these “freshwater fish” that's been spotted off the coasts of Costa del Sol─that's been feeding off the carcasses of some unfortunate creatures.\nIf you could slay some of these fish, and bring me their blood, I think I might be able to glean some valuable information.\nI've seen some “freshwater fish” that look remarkably similar to the ones you killed. I wonder if they're related?\nI'm sorry to have sent you to such a dangerous place, but would you be able to bring me the blood of some of the fish that look remarkably similar to the ones you killed?\nThe spotted fish I'm looking for are thought to grow and feed off the carcasses of marine creatures. If you can find and slay as many of these fish as I ask, I might be able to learn a thing or two about their fates.\nOh, and if you happen to come across any young fish in their dying state, you have my permission to kill them as well.\nI can't say I know much of these fish's physiology, but seeing as they're already dead, I imagine that killing them will hasten their demise.\nOf course, I'm sure that more research will be needed before we can draw any real conclusions. Costa del Sol is fortunate to have such a talented researcher as you here, Forename."]

Dialogue: ['\nGullinkambi:', '\nMy, what a peculiar familiar you are. I am sorry to call you “boy” but “child” seems more appropriate.\nThough I suppose you are not a child any more.

As a matter of fact, I would like you to assist me in a task that will hopefully bring you valuable experience.\nI need you to search for two objects that I believe should be left behind.

You have my deepest gratitude.\nI was not exaggerating when I said that I wished to make use of your expertise. I would be forever in your debt if you could continue to search for more items of this nature.\nIf I were to ask for your assistance again, perhaps I would be more inclined to discuss the finer points of your task. Perhaps I might even make it a profession.\nI am certain that you already know this, but do not hesitate to return to me again should you wish to master this new trade.']
