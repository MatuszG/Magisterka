Dialogue: ['\nBaderon:', "\nForename, I've heard the tales. You're not like your father─at least, not in your heart. I've heard the tales, and I've concluded that you're not like your father at all.\nYou see, my son was set upon a path of righteousness, one that would see him crowned king if he were ever to complete his training.\nBut then the gods took a look at him and said, “This one is not fit for the task.” And so he was conscripted into the imperial army.\nWhen he returned, he told me he was to fight for the Empire. I told him I would fight for him, but that I would do it myself. But then the gods told me that I would die fighting for the Empire, and so he was made to fight in secret.\nThat is why I have kept this from you. I fear it would put my son at great risk if you learned of his enlistment. I would rather it remain a secret, you see, so as to give my son the peace he so richly deserves.\nBut I am not sure you understand. I have told my comrades of your bravery, and they all tell me that you are a hero to them. It pains me to have kept this from you─I wish I could give you the same.\nBut I know one thing for certain─you are a far braver man than any of the men I have ever met. So I would ask you not to burden yourself with my shame. Tell your comrades of your bravery, and they will come to know you for a true hero.\nI am not sure I can properly thank you for this, but hear me out. Tell your comrades of your bravery, and they will come to know you for a true hero.\n", '\nSultansworn Squire:', '\n...You are a hero to us, Forename?

We would not have come to avenge his father if he had not told us what he has done.\nHe served in the sultana's guard for many years, until he was called to duty. He saw much and risked much for the Empire.\nBut now that he is a conscript, he is not allowed to speak his mind freely. He must remain silent, that he might tell his father what has become of him.', '\nBaderon:', "\nI hear you went and told my son of his enlistment. I'm sure he was proud of you for it.\nI imagine he's eager to hear about all of the brave men who helped him to become the hero he is now.

While there, I stumbled upon a peculiar plant─a bioluminescent bloom, to be precise. Curious, I tried to grow it myself, but it would not cease making buzzing noises. I daresay a friend of mine has it, but I cannot bring myself to harvest it myself.\nInstead, I turned to you, Forename. Costa del Sol is teeming with life, and a bioluminescent bloom is sure to attract a lot of attention. I would be ever so grateful if you could remove it from the path.\nThe bloom is a simple enough creation─simply mix some of this nutrient-rich solution with the surrounding water, and watch the critters go wild!\nCosta del Sol is also home to a peculiar species of fish, the melanion. I have heard they are quite intelligent, and are known to build nests in the rocks. The thought of having my own personal pool of fish is frankly too much to bear.\nStill, I daresay a spotless life is not what we Costa del Sol dwell for─a pristine paradise where man and fish can live in harmony. I aim to restore that which was lost during the Calamity─a verdant paradise where man and fish can coexist in peace.\nCosta del Sol is more than my own little experiment─I want it to be a place where people from all walks of life can feel welcome. Costa del Sol will be a place where people from all walks of life can live in harmony─a place where a Costa del Sol becomes a home, not a battlefield.\nI thank you for standing with me during those trying times, Forename. I look forward to seeing Costa del Sol thrive once more. Take care, and godsspeed.']

Dialogue: ['\nCeana:', "\nHow do you do there, traveler?\n...Oh. I'm still here.\nThis is the first time I've ventured outside the Crystarium in quite a while.\nIt's been some time since I was last on the moon. It feels like an eternity ago.\nI was looking out over the northern reaches when I heard a buzzing sound. I assumed it was a bug or something, but then I saw a tiny glowing orb. Curious, I got on my knees and peered inside.\nIt looked like a bee─or possibly a wasp, if you're familiar with the creature. At any rate, it wasn't long before I learned that the orb belonged to a Lalafellion.\nThe creatures born from the lightning that strikes the moon are known as Lalafellions.\nThey're quite docile, to be sure, but they do require a bit of a lickspray to make sure they don't get too big.\nThat's why I wanted you to collect the orb. I'm sure you have your hands full as it is, so I won't bother explaining what it is.\nPlease, go and collect the Lalafellion orb from the tree to the north. I'm sure you do have your hands full as it is, so I won't bother explaining what it is.\nI'm fairly certain I heard the buzzing sound coming from that tree. Did you find it?", '\nPop:', '\nYou sense a hostile presence!', '\nCeana:', '\nDid you find the orb?', '\nCeana:', "\nThis is it! My, that's a pretty hefty orb you have there. I'll admit, I wasn't expecting a Lalafellion to be so big...\nBut that's not to say it's worthless. The orb contains the memories of the Lalafellion.\nIn the Lalafellion's case, that means the memories of the one who was born from lightning that struck the moon.\nLalafellions are extremely rare, and it's not uncommon for one to be stolen before the others are born.\nIf it's a boy, the parents are usually tricked into giving up their child by the thieves. In rarer cases, however, a Lalafellion may be found in its parents' arms, still alive and kicking.\nUnfortunately, the thieves are rarely caught. Most prefer to take the child and run, rather than give it up.\nWhile it's unfortunate, we shouldn't give up on these rare sightings just yet. In fact, I believe we ought to keep looking for more.\nI'll share this with the others as well as you. If you can find even a single Lalafellion, we can continue our work together!"]

It was there that I began to meditate upon the horn.\nAfter returning to Namai, I have continued to meditate upon the amaro horn.
