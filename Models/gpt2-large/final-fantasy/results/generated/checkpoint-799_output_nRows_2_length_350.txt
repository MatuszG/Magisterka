Dialogue: ['\nGerbert:', "\nIt's my idea!\nThe bees are ready to make their own honey!\nAnd if you've got the time, I would like to show you how.\nSo take this box of beeswax and sprinkle it on the ground in the vicinity of the hive.\nWhen the bees arrive, sprinkle a bit on their heads. Then, take some of the wax to Gerbert and he will show you how to make it into a paste.\nI'll take the rest to you.", '\nGerbert:', "\nThe bees are so kind.

Dialogue: ['\nGilliam:', '\nAh, Forename! A pleasure to have you here. I hope your time with the Alliance has been pleasant.\nThe Alliance has grown stronger since your arrival, and it would seem we have more pressing concerns.\nWe will have need of your help once more, but I would ask that you speak with one of the members of the Alliance's Security Council.', '\nGilliam:', '\nAs it turns out, I was mistaken when I asked the Alliance for aid. The council members were in fact speaking with a Resistance Resistance fighter, and it was his intention to convey that the Alliance would be sending an expeditionary force to the Twelveswood.\nHowever, this man had some peculiar request. He asked that the Alliance send a large contingent of soldiers, which it did.\nHowever, the Alliance is a council, not an army. It is not our place to ask for military assistance.\nInstead, we would be grateful if you would assist us in securing the safety of the Twelveswood.\nWe would also be grateful if you would take this matter to the leaders of the Alliance and ask them to make a request of their own.', '\nPop:', '\nYou are being watched!', '\nGilliam:', '\nThe Alliance leaders were most receptive to your request, and they have agreed to send an expeditionary force to the Twelveswood. Please, take this as payment.']
