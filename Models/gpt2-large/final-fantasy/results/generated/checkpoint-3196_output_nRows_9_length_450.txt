Dialogue: ['\nBroomc:', "\nOi, you there. A visitor from Eil Tohm, if I may?\nYou'll be pleased to hear that my research on the aetherochemical composition of plants has received a great deal of attention. This is, of course, in addition to my previous work on the aetherochemical composition of fungi.\nWhile my previous work was focused on the aetherochemical composition of fungi, I believe my latest work, which deals with a plant's aetheric composition, may prove of interest to a layperson.\nA common misconception is that plants simply absorb aether, without any contribution from the aetherial species composing the plant. However, a plant does not simply absorb aether; rather, it utilizes aetherial species as a means to facilitate growth.\nFor example, a brambleweed's aether is utilized as a nutrient-rich fertilizer by the crops it pollinates.\nOr take a look at the aetherial composition of a certain species of fungus. You'll find that, when mature, the aether is found to be positively replete with aetherial species.\nWhile these observations do not constitute a convincing demonstration of a direct relationship, they may nevertheless provide insight into the processes by which plants use aether as a nutrient.\nIn any case, I thank you for bringing my research to a larger audience. I look forward to your future research! Please accept this as a token of my thanks."]

I wish I could've been there to see you off, but...well, we both know that wouldn't have been good for me.\nAnyway, I'd like to thank you once more on behalf of everyone here.

I wish you the best in whatever way you decide to take up the rebuilding effort.\nRight, I'd best get back to work. Do you have any questions?\n...No? Then I guess I'm off to do my thing.
