Dialogue: ['\nBertliana:', '\nIt is good to see you again, Forename. I have some news to share with you.\nA while ago, I received word from Lord Haurchefant that a company of marauders had been dispatched to the southwestern region of Coerthas.\nThe company was to be comprised of veteran adventurers who had faced the worst of the beast tribes. They were to be tasked with securing our southern border.\nWord quickly spread through Gridania that these marauders were to be the front line in our defense.\nLord Haurchefant even went so far as to suggest that the marauders be equipped with weapons stolen from the sin eaters.\nIt has long been my dream to join the knights in arms and fight at the side of our allies. But I know that now is not the time.\nI have decided that I must needs journey to the southwestern region and see the task of securing our southern border completed.\nI would be grateful if you would accompany me. As we speak, our scouts are setting up a new outpost in the area. I would be ever so grateful if you could assist in keeping our allies safe.\nPray return to the Waking Sands and meet with me in my chambers. I would be ever so grateful if you could assist in keeping our allies safe.', '\nBertliana:', '\nHow fare you?\nI take it you have already seen to the task of securing our southern border? Splendid! I shall rest easier now knowing that my superiors can count on my assistance.\nTo business, then. I have a report that must be delivered to my superiors at the Rising Stones.\nI trust you are aware that our scouts are setting up a new outpost in the southwestern region? It is a staging point for our patrols.\nThey are currently assessing the land around Bentbranch Meadows. I would have you take this report to your superior at the Rising Stones.\nMy report will also serve as a primer on our new mission. It is my hope that it will serve as a useful primer for our new recruits.\nPlease take this for your time. I would be ever so grateful if you could relay to my superiors at the Rising Stones all that you have learned here.']

They were given to me by a fellow named U'odh Nunh.\nI placed them in my pocket along with the money I received from Redbrix. I plan to sell them soon, but I'm not sure what I'll do with them.

I have not been able to purchase any other items on my own and this will help me to pay for my wife's medicine.\nI was told that the people of Redbrix often trade with adventurers. It would mean a lot to me if you could help me. I could not bear to part with these chains and I would go myself if I could.\nYou should know, though, that I have not been paid for my services. I had hoped to make about three gil from each of the chains.\nRedbrix is a hub for those who trade with the Resistance. It is a difficult business to do, but some of the people there have managed to make a living. I would be honored if you could place some of my bindle chains in their hands.\nI cannot thank you enough for this. I will continue to do what I can to help my fellow man, but I fear I will never be able to repay you for your kindness."]

Dialogue: ['\nAlphinaud:', "\nAh, Forename. I trust you are enjoying your atma–infused relic?\nNow, while it does indeed enhance your weapon, the soul of the weapon is what truly makes it a weapon. And as such, it is not possible to enchant the soul of a weapon once it has been forged.\nThis is where your story begins, I am sure. When you first joined the guild, I had no doubt that you would make a fine weapon, and I was certain that your soul would make a fine soul weapon.\nBut I had no idea that the soul of a weapon would be so important.\nNow, while it is true that souls can be traded, souls are not, at least not in the way you are used to think.\nInstead, your weapon will be infused with the souls of slain foes.\nThe weapon will then be able to better defend against those that would bring ruin to Ishgard.\nAnd thus will you be prepared when the time comes to bestow your weapon's soul upon its new wielder.\nBut enough about souls. I would have you take this to your fellow weaponwrights. Show them this, and perhaps they will be inspired to take up the sword and make a fine weapon of you!\nThe weaponwrights of the South Shroud are in need of a soul to craft their weapons.\nPlease bring these to the smith named Ysandel in the Hall of Flames in East Hawkers' Alley.\nAnd tell him that your soul will be used to craft his next weapon.", '\nYsandel:', '\nSo you are finally ready to work with souls? Very well, I will give this a try.\nPlease be warned that this process is irreversible. Should the weapon be used without the soul, it will be lost.\nThe soul is what gives a weapon its sheen, or what makes it special. The souls of all creatures, be they beasts or men, are gathered here.\nYou will find that this is the most difficult area to work in. Do not be surprised if you do not finish in time.\nBut do not despair, Forename. With each new soul that is infused into the weapon, the properties of the weapon will change.\nThis will allow you to achieve a greater mastery of the sword.\nPlease be aware that while each soul is valuable, their use will also cost you.\nBut do not worry, Forename. I will make it worth your while.']

It might not look like much at first, but it'll make you a better smith if you know what to do with it.\nAnd since you're here, I might as well show you how it's done. So, what do you say? Are you interested in learning more?", '\nGullinkambi:', "\nThere's no better way to learn than from experience. If you're willing to put your learning to the test, then meet me outside. I'll explain everything in more detail later.\nNow, this is the axe I forged for you. It's the same one I used to create the Braves' weapons. It was a while ago now that I refined it further.\nWhen I first started working on the weapons, I knew I wanted to make them as powerful as I could. After seeing you fight, though, I think I've hit on a good balance.\nThe weapon has a base weight of 85, and an increase in strength can be achieved by mixing different types of materials.\nFor this particular project, however, the idea was to mix oak with cobalt to make a stronger, yet more portable weapon.\nWhen it's fully mixed, the resulting alloy will be strong enough to pierce even the thickest of monster hides, yet still have enough strength to slice through the tough stuff.\nThe alloy will also be useful for crafting other types of gear, such as cages and barricades.\nThe process of mixing the metals in this way is called agglomeration.\nIt's not the most complex process, but it does require a certain amount of attention to ensure that all the components are working together as intended.\nBefore I show you the axe, however, I need you to gather some of the other materials I need for the project.\nThese bags of cobalt ore can be found just outside the cave where I work. You should be able to find some just outside the cave, though it might be a bit tricky to find the one with the ore in it.\nThe ore is usually found in sandy areas, but it's possible to find it elsewhere as well.

Thus did they vie for power and influence, seeking to seize control of every piece of territory they could lay claim to.\nIn the end, they were driven from their lands by the Gnath.\

Thus, it is now believed that they may be “informed” by the entities that inhabit our world.\nThough we have made great strides in our understanding of these beings, it is still not enough to allow us to reach a true understanding.\nIt is on the level of this “informedness” that I believe we stand to learn the most.\nThe primals are said to have existed prior to the dawn of creation, but the evidence for this is lacking.\nIt would be a tremendous boon to our knowledge if we were to gain an understanding of what led to their primality.\nIf we are to do this, however, it is imperative that we first gain access to their memories.\nFor this, we have employed a method unique to our species─the memex.\nFor each of the primals we identify, we ask a different question, based on which memories we hope to glean insight.\nFor each question, we chose a different question from those asked prior to. This way, we will inevitably come across the primals we sought to study.\nThe study of the primals is thus both an academic and a personal endeavor.\nFor your own benefit, I hope that this knowledge may one day serve to guide you. For my benefit, I hope that this knowledge may one day serve to guide you.\nNow, I think that I have sufficiently explained the nature of the primals. If there is anything else you would like me to

All I know is that a unit of Ala Mhigo's finest is on patrol, and that they are presently searching for...something.\nThey were last sighted west of here, in the region known as the Lochs. It is not my place to speculate on their whereabouts, however─that would be for the Ala Mhigan Resistance to do so.\nAs you are already aware, the Resistance has been charged with the protection of the bardiche─a.k.a. the Coliseum champion─from the Ixal.\nAla Mhigans are not wont to turn a blind eye to their fellow man, but the chance that our fellow Ala Mhigans may turn a blind eye to our cause is too great to ignore.\nPlease, Urianger, go to the Lochs and see what you can learn of our plight.', '\nPop:', '\nYou sense a hostile presence!', '\nAccess:', '\nThe enemy is still about!', '\nUrianger:', '\nSo you went to the Lochs, and braved the enemy's clutches to learn of our plight. I am heartily glad for this news.\nThe unit I spoke of was dispatched to the area to search for a potential site for a new training facility.\nAla Mhigans are not wont to turn a blind eye to their fellow man, but the chance that our fellow Ala Mhigans may turn a blind eye to our cause is too great to ignore.\nI am glad you were there to lend a hand. I pray our comrades will not forget your assistance.']

I need you to go there, and gather information.\nTalk with the locals, and learn what they know of the Allied forces. You should be able to find a Maelstrom officer by the name of Haukke. He should be able to tell you a lot!', '\nHaukke:', '\nI am Haukke, Maelstrom officer. What can I help you with?', '\nHaukke:', "\nI gather from your expression that you are not from around here. Do you perchance know a comrade in the Allied forces?\nI would like very much to know of their strength and strategy. I could use some help gathering this information.\nI have been told to go to Carteneau and gather information on the Allied forces. Please hurry along! There is a Maelstrom officer waiting for you near the Save the Trees.", '\nHaukke:', '\nPlease go to Carteneau and gather information on the Allied forces. Make sure to speak with the locals.', '\nHaukke:', '\nYou have gathered some information, yes? Very helpful! I could use some more!\nI have been told to go to Carteneau and gather information on the Allied forces. Please hurry along!

There is a Maelstrom officer waiting for you near the Save the Trees.', '\nHaukke:', '\nSo, what did you learn?\nThey are indeed a strong and strategic force, but...their tactics leave much to be desired.\nThey are...well, they are. I find myself agreeing with what Master said about them.\nBut they are a force to be reckoned with! As long as there is a war to fight, we must all be on our guard!\nThank you for helping me gather this information. Please inform Master that I shall be on my way to Tailfeather soon!', '\nKomuxio:', '\nForename! I have a task for you! Please go to the Save the Trees and speak with the locals!', '\n

Dialogue: ['\nZlatan:', "\nWe are always glad to see our patrons return, but I must confess I was looking forward to your next appearance.\nYou are more than a mere familiar, Forename. You are a native of Sharlayan, a man with a strong conviction about you. A conviction that will not be easily shaken.\nAnd I do mean that in the literal sense. If you are to succeed in your endeavor, you must abandon all hope of success and embrace the hardships of the road.\nYou will succeed or you will fail, but if you try and fail, you will never know for certain. Make no mistake, Forename. There is no guarantee of success.\nYou have set a high standard for yourself, and it is high time you met with another such standard.\nIn fact, you are precisely the sort of familiar I seek. If you would be so kind as to travel to Dravania, I would have you accompany me on my next foray.\n", '\nZlatan:', '\nYou are returned, and in one piece, I see. I trust you are ready to set forth on your journey once more?', '\nZlatan:', '\nVery good. I will trust in your abilities this time, and look to you for guidance.\nI shall depart for Dravania now, but you may call upon me should you have further questions or need assistance on your journey. I look forward to our next adventure.']
