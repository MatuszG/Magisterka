Title: A Blessed Instrument
Dialogue: ['\nMinfilia:', "\nGreetings, Forename. I trust you've had a chance to rest since last we met.\nI had a thought to have you craft a new musical instrument, but the matter is not new─the history of our people is rife with the arts of war, you see.\nIt is all the more reason that we must tread carefully when attempting to recreate a relic from ancient times.\nBut with your help, we might accomplish something far more interesting than mere ornamentation. As you know, the Warring Triad sought to harness the power of music to overcome all obstacles─the ultimate in futility.\nAnd in order to that end, they commissioned the creation of a sacred horn─a piece of art that is a living testament to their ambitions and a testament to the futility of their efforts.\nIn order to realize their ultimate dream, they sacrificed a great hero─Varnhmana, in our case─and a host of renowned scholars.\nIt is my hope that you can bring us the Horn of Varnhmana.\nIt is said that the first time the horn was played was when the Warring Triad fell upon Ala Mhigo, and that its song brought the city together.\nMy hope is that the Warring Triad will one day find the means to call upon its power once more, and that the horn will bring them together once more.\nIn the meantime, I would ask that you retrieve its crystal for us.\nWith the aid of an alchemist, I would see you capable of crafting a suitable crystal from a single tree─a trunk from a maple bough.\nOnce you have achieved this feat, please deliver it to Rowena, the leader of the Warring Triad.\nIn case you have forgotten, the bough in question can be found to the northwest of here. Please hurry, before the trees begin to cry for their dear lives.", '\nRowena:', '\nHail, adventurer. What might a warrior of your means be looking for?\nAh, the Horn of Varnhmana! The Warring Triad commissioned this masterpiece of destruction, and it is my hope that you might one day use its power to bring them all together once more.\nI would ask that you retrieve its crystal for us.', '\nRowena:', '\nHail, adventurer.

The Warring Triad's ultimate wish has come to fruition, and their sacrifice will be forever honored by the elementals.\nIt is for this reason that we must tread carefully when attempting to recreate a relic from ancient times.\nWhile we are on the subject of ancient times, perhaps you might be interested in exploring a different possibility.\nOne that might provide us with an alternative to the traditional methods of reconstruction.\nI would ask you to seek out an alchemist within the city and perform a potion of creation.\nIn the meantime, I would ask that you retrieve its crystal for us.\nWith the aid of an alchemist, I would see you capable

It is a relic from the Age of Heroes, and it is something of a treat to behold in person.\nFor a long time I resented its presence in the ruins, but now that it is here I cannot help but admire its splendor.\nIf you would take it up, it would be a great help.
