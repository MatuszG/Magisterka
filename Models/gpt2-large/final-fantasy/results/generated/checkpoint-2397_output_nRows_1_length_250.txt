You see, my friend Mogmont, a merchant from Ul'dah, has agreed to supply us with fresh meats at a discount.\nMogmont is a well-traveled man, and we've been frequenting the markets ever since our arrival here.\nAs such, we've been keeping a keen eye on the prices of meats in the markets─and I'm happy to say that we're now half a denier. That's right, we can afford to offer them at half the usual price!\nWhat's more, Mogmont is one of the most popular merchants in Ul'dah, and we've been inundated with requests for his wares.\nMy thanks to you, friend. Here, take this as a token of our appreciation."]

Dialogue: ['\nU'tykhatia:', "You look to be a stout lad. Might I ask a small favor?\nI have a task for you. It will take you to Namai, but do not worry, it is simple.\nTake yourself west and then east to the village. There you will find a young girl named U'kahzuna.\nShe is, quite simply, a thief. She has taken from the village an amaro whose horns she has carved with her own hands.\nThe horn she has taken is not the horn of an ordinary amaro, however. It is the horn of a rare and mighty gigan. It is no ordinary gigan that she has taken, mind you. She is a very special one, and I am certain that you will not find her anywhere else in the world.\nI would ask you to take the amaro's horn to U'kahzuna. That will be your task, and you will need her cooperation. You need not take the horn to her alone, of course. I will wait here.\nI know what you are thinking. Why
