Dialogue: ['\nNanamo Ul Namo:', "\nAh, there you are. I was hoping to thank you for your efforts with the Scions. I must say, I'm not surprised.\nYou see, the Order of the Twin Adder has been tasked with overseeing the restoration of the Ruby Road─a road which was once the main route between Ul'dah and Gridania.\nHowever, the road was closed off many years ago, and the Order has been unable to reclaim it.\nThe road was originally named for one of our Order members─a man named Gundobald. However, it has since been occupied by the Garleans, who have erected a wall to keep those who oppose their rule out.\nThe barrier, which was first erected in the wake of the Calamity, was intended to prevent any further attacks on the Ruby Road, but it seems that the Garleans are not content to wait.\nInstead, they've decided to target our Order's members and the surrounding settlement. While we have no choice but to fight back, I fear that we may be forced to retreat.\nSo, I thought I would offer my assistance in putting down the Garleans. If you could help us in that endeavor, I would be most obliged.\nWe've received word that a unit of the Garleans has been spotted in the Ruby Road. We need to hurry and take them down before they can cause any more trouble.\nI hope you will join us in the battle. I can already hear the distant sounds of battle echoing through the forest. I will join you in the battle, of course, but I should warn you that this is a long one.\nThe Ruby Road is a main route between Ul'dah and Gridania. It was once lined with watchtowers, and was home to many an Ul'dahn family.\nHowever, the Garleans have constructed a wall to keep anyone who dares to cross its perimeter out. We must take down that wall before it can do any further damage.\nThere's been talk of sending an adventurer to help us with this. If you are willing to aid us in taking down the Garleans, I would be most obliged.\nIt is the duty of every adventurer in the Ruby Road to defend the road against any who would attempt to reestablish the road. I ask that you do this on my behalf.\nI must say, I was surprised by how well you fought. I had feared that the Garleans would make use of you.\nHowever, I am glad to see that you have proven your mettle.

Title: A Brave Resolution
Dialogue: ['\nAuphiliot:', '\nThe gods do not spare the courageous. But the brave must be willing, too.\nWe must needs find a way to protect the forest. To that end, I have a proposal to make.', '\nAuphiliot:', '\nWe are to search for a suitable location to plant our flag.\nI shall inform you of the location in due time. I do hope you will not hesitate to aid us in our search.', '\nAuphiliot:', '\nYou will be pleased to know that there are already some who wish to aid you.\nI have already given you an explanation of the situation. You may have heard rumors of the forest, but we will need to conduct thorough investigations to find the suitable location.', '\nAuphiliot:', '\nI must admit, I was a bit flabbergasted when I heard you had chosen to locate your flag in this manner.\nBut you are right. Our forest is not made of roses and peonies. It is made of countless creatures, some of which pose a threat to our way of life.\nIt is for this reason that I have chosen to protect this forest with the flag we have chosen. Please do not mistake my decision for weakness.']
