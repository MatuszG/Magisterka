He's the one who will be coordinating our mission.\nYou have my sincerest thanks. The gloves will have to go to our next destination.", '\nEsmour:', "\nThat's a relief. I was afraid the gloves would end up in the wrong hands.\nBut what's worse, they've been missing for quite some time. It's possible someone has been keeping them, or that they've been stolen.\nAnyroad, thank you, and I hope it brings you some solace.\nI've got one last task for you, Forename. It's something I would have done myself, but I'm afraid it's too dangerous.\nYou see, I'm looking into the history of the Garleans. I was hoping you could help me with this.\nThe Garleans were once a force to be reckoned with, but they've been mostly wiped out by the Flood.\nThe reason for their decline is their ability to produce aether. It's the reason why they were forced to surrender themselves to the Flood.\nThis knowledge is something they need, but it's all we have to go on.\nIf we are to reclaim our homeland, we must learn to produce aether from scratch. I would ask you to find a man named Doma.\nHe has a great deal of knowledge of Garlean history. He may have something of use for you."]
