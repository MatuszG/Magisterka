Dialogue: ['\nGildon:', "I don't recall seeing you here before. Tell me, have you heard of a “bargain trader” named Lamberteint?\n...He's one of Ishgard's more discerning merchants, I hear.

Why would we ever arm ourselves with a Garlean weapon?\nThis Garlean weapon has been in the possession of a Garlean general since before the Garleans came. We should never have allowed such a weapon to leave our possession!\nIt's all right, I understand. The Vundu Khaa are a peaceful people, and we shouldn't have treated them like a conquered people. But the Garleans were supposed to be our allies!\nThey had to be if they meant to keep the peace. But I... I'm sorry. I'm sorry I let you down.\nI hope you'll forgive me. I'm a better person than I was before.\nI won't go back there again. I won't let Garleans keep trying to take my weapons. Please, take this as a token of my apology."]

Title: A Bargain Struck
Dialogue: ['\nGigi:', "\nAh, adventurer! I've been looking for you! You've a good lookin' for a job.\nA friend of mine was about to deliver some gil to a friend of mine, and I was thinking of how I could repay him for his kindness. I've got a job for you, if you're interested.\nThe man's name's Dragan. He's a researcher at the Crystarium, and he'll be able to tell you what I need.\nFirst things first, though: I need you to retrieve some crystals for me. They're quite rare, so it'll take some work, but it can't hurt to have a little help.\nThere's a cave north of here, but I'll need you to go there and collect four of them. Don't worry─I'll get the crystals for you─just bring me the crystals.", '\nDragan:', "\nGigi's got a job for you? He should know. I've been expecting you.\nIt's a bit of a bother getting the crystals, but I reckon I can handle it. Thanks for the help, though!\nGigi's a good sort. He's even promised to reward you for your trouble. Don't tell him I said that!", '\nGigi:', "\nYou're back! Did you find what I asked for?\nAh, so the crystals are ready. I thought you were going to be the one who gets them, but I suppose it was a mistake.\nIt's a shame, really. We had a lot of fun working with them. They'll be perfect for my new magitek armor, and I'll be able to repair the reactor and run it for a bit longer.\nThis is my first job as an adventurer, and I'm glad I came. I could've done with a bit more work, though. I'll be sure to repay you for your help in the future!"]
