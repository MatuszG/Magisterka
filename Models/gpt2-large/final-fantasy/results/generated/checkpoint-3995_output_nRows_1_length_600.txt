I'm a sellsword myself, but I've a wide background in arms and armor.\nI was on the opposite side of the coin as you are now, but I've no doubt that you've acquired a handle on things─much as I've.\nNow, what I require is a suitable sample of dragon scale armor, ideally wrought from a pristine sample of dragon scale.\nOf course, it goes without saying that I require a living specimen.\nI would make my living selling such samples, you being as curious as I. I had a feeling you might be the sort that might take an interest.\nIt's no easy thing making your way to the battlefield, and even if you should, pray make good use of your time. I cannot emphasize that point enough.\nNow, to what end you ask? Well, there is an ancient tradition of exchanging scales for otherworldly wares.\nIn my homeland, the Dragonsong War─or what's left of it─took place, and scales are prized as a form of currency.\nIn fact, it was once customary to offer your wares in exchange for dragon scales─a practice I made possible by trading with the Dravanians.\nAs scales are said to possess certain medicinal properties, I thought it might be of interest to develop a line of armor that could be used to treat a wide variety of ailments.\nAnd yes, I did consider using dragon scales in my casting. Alas, the task was far from simple.\nTo begin with, I needed a sample of dragon scale armor that could be used to create my own unique pieces.\nBut how? One of the more common methods of slaying dragons is to use poison.\nPoisonous scales, however, are not only difficult to come by, but also expensive─not to mention the fact that most who try die in the attempt.\nThankfully, I didn't have to turn to such measures to receive what I requested.\nWhen it comes to armor, there are certain things which no one should have to pay for.\nThe gods above have blessed me with a healthy body, so anything that might impede me should be ignored.\nThat's all in the past, I swear! Now, what say you? Will you be taking a look at my work?\nMy armor─if you can call it that─is comprised of a mix of dragon scale and steel. It is quite complex, so I won't keep you from learning all you can.\nYou'll need a sword to begin with, so if you're wondering how you can obtain one, worry not.\nIf you would, pray meet me near the southwestern gate of the Sultansworn Quarter.", '\
