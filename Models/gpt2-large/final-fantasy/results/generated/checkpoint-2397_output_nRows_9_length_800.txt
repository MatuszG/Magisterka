Dialogue: ['\nGiott:', '\nWell met, adventurer. I am Giott, a proud member of Clan Centurio─a proud man of the Leatherworkers' Guild─and proud to say that I have forged weapons and armor for both the Horde and the Alliance.\nBut I would speak to you directly, adventurer. Would you be willing to aid a weary craftsman in his time of need?\nI was recently approached by a merchant who wishes to purchase a greatsword. The weapon is a treasured family heirloom, and he is keen to have it appraised.\nI would not be at liberty to say who he is, for the sake of the transaction, of course. But I do know that he is a man of great means, who has visited the guild often and with great wealth.\nAnd I am told that this time he is seeking a blade of high-quality─one that can cut through fiends like the wind.\nTo that end, he is offering a hefty sum for its appraisal. I would offer you a portion of this, but I fear that my words may frighten him. Might you speak with him for me?\nPlease, speak with this merchant and receive his full share of the fee.', '\nGiott:', "\nHmmm... Yes, I am Giott. What is your name?\n...Hm? What is this all about?\nOh, yes. You will be pleased to know that my wares are nothing short of unparalleled.\nYou see, I have been working tirelessly to develop a line of quality arms. To that end, I have scoured the realm, visiting every corner of the realm, seeking out the finest materials and craftsmen.\nBut I am also a man of many regrets, you see. While my research was never without its joy, my passion for arms was never matched by my skill with the bow.\nI was never good at using it. And the countless arms I forged never met with satisfactory results.\nIt was during one such foray into the realm that I came across a greatsword of the type you describe. And it changed my entire perspective.\nFor a time, I believed that the greatsword was a tool only used by the elite of our realm. That it was unworthy of the name─that it should be relegated to mere decorative trinkets.\nBut then I met with the greatsword's true master─the greatsword itself. And I discovered that its true purpose was to bring about a new age of peace between nations.\nAnd it is for this reason that I have decided to offer you my wares. To show that such weapons can be used by the masses, and not relegated to the few, that the greatsword is not a mere decorative trinket.\nThat is why I am offering you this sword. To help bring about a new era of cooperation, and prosperity.\nNow, if you would allow me to explain my reasoning, it would hopefully put things in perspective.\n...And yet, I fear that I have no time for such explanations. I would ask that you take the weapon straight to the greatsword's owner.\nThat is all I can do, I am afraid.\nFor the sake of my wares, I would ask that you take this greatsword to the greatsword's owner─the greatsword itself.\nThat is all I can do, I am afraid.\nI ask that you do not take my word for it, of course. Speak with the greatsword's owner yourself and see what he thinks of my offering.\nThank you, adventurer. And I hope that you will not disappoint in your decision.\nNow then, I would ask that

Please, allow me to tell you more about what happened here.\nMy parents were a noble house, and they devoted their lives to the protection of the forest.\nTheir duty was to watch and guard the borders of the Vira. They never ceased to worry, and I can only imagine how deeply they felt for their lost loved ones.\nI know not how they saw the invaders, but they certainly did not take them lightly.\nI am sorry I could not give them the answers they deserved, but please know that I am grateful.

Title: A Beeautiful Plan
Dialogue: ['\nMogret:', "Greetings, adventurer. I have good news for you. I have a plan that should see us through to the end of this troublesome quest.\nIt is a long and arduous journey, one fraught with peril. It begins with finding the one we seek─a beekeeper─and the means by which he might be found.\nI would that I could do this task myself, but the task is not for me. I would only ask that you do it for me.\nI would ask you to speak with a fellow beekeeper named Ul Thon. He can tell you everything you need to know.\nIf you are successful in this mission, I am sure you will be compensated for your efforts. I also urge you to speak with my colleague, the beekeeper named Mogret. He can fill you in on the rest.", '\nMogret:', "Ul Thon should be able to fill you in on the rest. He can fill you in on the rest.", '\nMogret:', "You are returned. It is good to see you.\nYou see, the reason I asked you to speak with me was because of a rumor I heard. It goes something like this: some poor beekeeper stumbled upon a nest of giant wasps, only to be devoured by the beasts.\nIn the days before the Calamity, this was a common enough occurrence. However, the Calamity changed all that. Not only did the wasps become more aggressive, but they began laying their eggs on the nests of bees, too.\nNot only did this make the bees less effective as pollinators, but it also made it impossible for us to properly identify the culprit. We have been stymied in our efforts to track him down ever since.\nThis is why I am so determined to track down my suspect. I would hear his name from the first, even if it meant wasting precious time.\nI would ask you to speak with my colleague, the beekeeper named Mogret. He can fill you in on the rest.", '\nMogret:', "Ul Thon can fill you in on the rest. He can fill you in on the rest.", '\nMogret:', 'I had hoped you might bring me the answer I sought, but alas, you have not been of much help.

His insight was invaluable, and I am grateful for his continued support.\nMaster Mutamix was born into a wealthy family, and he used his wealth to further the advancement of art in Ul'dah.\nHe saw the wealth of the Ul'dahites and decided to share it with the people of his city─the rich and poor, the masters and their students, the laborers and their families.\nI am honored to be able to work alongside such an accomplished craftsman. I look forward to the day when I can offer you the opportunity to learn how I made the bezoar.\nI am also proud to say that my master made the bezoar in my workshop, not some faraway island. Master Mutamix's vision is truly inspiring, and I hope that you will one day be able to work with the same materials and techniques.\nIn the meantime, I would ask that you visit the Guild and learn more of our art.

For the sake of your own safety, I would strongly advise you to entrust the acquisition of these items to someone you trust.\nNow, if you will excuse me, I shall prepare the necessary items for you.\nI would strongly advise you to entrust the acquisition of these items to someone you trust.

The question is whether we will be able to live with such a world.\nI had thought that the war would end with the defeat of our nation's enemy. But I see that my fears were misplaced.\nI shall have to take a more measured approach to my future endeavors. For now, I would ask that you aid me once more.\nPlease, take this as a token of my gratitude. I hope you will help me once again."]

Dialogue: ['\nEschiva:', "\nWell, you have a sight to see for yourself. The settlement known as the “Brazen Bruiser” was spared by the Calamity─a small miracle, to be sure, but one that nevertheless serves to remind us that we must not take our fate in our own hands.\nThe settlement was built to the south, on the site of a former military encampment. While it was never meant to be a permanent home, it was never intended to last beyond its capacity to absorb refugees.\nAs such, we were able to house some forty refugees in the first floor─more if I count the children─and some fifteen in the second and third.\nBut it is no exaggeration to say that the Brazen Bruiser's residents are a testament to the effectiveness of the aid we have given. Not a day goes by that we do not count the number of folk who have come to our aid, and the number grows by the day.\nIt is thanks to them that the Bruiser's residents can continue to live in relative peace. Indeed, one might say that the settlement's continued existence is thanks in part to the efforts of the Scions.\nIt may come as a surprise, but the settlement's leaders are not the ones who first conceived the idea of turning the Brazen Bruiser into a residential district. That honor belongs instead to the leaders of the nearby settlement, namely the leaders of Bentbranch Meadows.\nIt was they who first conceived the notion of turning the Bruiser into a residential district, and they alone were responsible for organizing the settlement's reconstruction.\nThe settlement's leaders were of the same mind as the Scions, and they knew that turning the Brazen Bruiser into a residential district would not only be a boon to the surrounding area, but also a boon to the Scions themselves.\nSo it was that the leaders decided to form an association to bring the refugees together, to see that the settlement would not be forced to dismantle its defenses─an arrangement that would prove mutually beneficial to both sides.\nThat endeavor began with the founding of the Brazen Bruiser District, and it is our hope that the settlement can continue to welcome new residents in the future.\nAs such, I am pleased to announce that the Bruiser's residents have officially reorganized into a single-member association, the Bentbranch Consortium. As such, the Bruiser's residents can now discuss and act upon their common concerns in greater detail.\nTo that end, the Brazen Bruiser's residents have formed a Committee of Concern, with representatives from across the settlement contributing to its work.\nOf course, the Bentbranch Consortium will be continuing to do all in its power to aid the refugees, but we aim to make the most of what we have received from the start.\nAnd so, I would ask that you lend us your assistance once again. Speak with our representative, and she will guide you through the process.", '\nEschiva:', '\nYou have spoken with our representative, and she has given you an overview of the settlement's current status? Truly, you are an inspiration. You have done us a great service, and for that, I am grateful.\nNow then, I would ask that you take up your new responsibilities with the utmost haste. We would not be able to survive without your aid!']
