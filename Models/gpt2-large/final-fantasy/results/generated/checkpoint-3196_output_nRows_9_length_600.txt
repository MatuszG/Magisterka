He is a man of great honor and responsibility, one who has tirelessly served our cause.\nFew men in history have wielded such a steed, and none in our current situation are fit to ride it.\nYour task will be to find him, and to ensure that he arrives safely.\nTo that end, I ask that you keep watch for any imperials who may be approaching the steed.\nPlease make your way to the Eulmoran steed, and find Merlwyb.", '\nMerlwyb:', '\nAh, Forename, you are returned. I feared for a moment that you would not arrive.\nYou see, I was preparing for a flight to deliver supplies to the Resistance when my comrades and I received word that an imperial vessel had come to anchor nearby.\nMy initial plan was to fly to the ship and ensure that we had all of our supplies, but I reconsidered when I saw the damage caused by the imperials.\nIf we are to save the Resistance, we must do it without delay.\nI would go straight to the ship, but I fear that I would not last another minute on the ground. Please, keep watch for any approaching imperials.', '\nMerlwyb:', '\nI thank you for watching over us. I am glad that we were able to reach our destination without incident.\nMy thanks also to you for escorting our comrade to safety. It would have been a terrible waste of time had he met an untimely demise.\nThe Eulmoran steed is one of our most valuable treasures, and I would do anything to have it.\nUnfortunately, it is not only the imperials that seek to take it. Those who oppose us are constantly plotting ways to undermine our efforts.\nWhile it is easy to point fingers at those involved, it would be much more effective if we could marshal the strength of the Resistance to drive them from our lands.\nThat is why I have chosen to focus on one enemy at a time. Soon, I shall return to the task of delivering these supplies.']

The sword used to slay the great Humes is chosen because it best represents his strength. The sword used to slay the great Bismarck is chosen because it best represents his strength.\nNow, imagine how amazing it is to have the full history behind each of these pieces!

That was courage.\nSo go forth, Forename, and inspire others to live their courage.
