Do you have the message?\nI see... Well, I suppose I should give it a try.\nTo complete the mission, we must reach Fury's Gaze, a place shrouded in mystery that few have been able to reach.\nTo reach it, we must use the forbidden gemstone known as the prism.\nBut to procure it, we must first defeat a fiend known as a keeper of the winds.\nAnd judging by the appearance of this fellow, he is no ordinary fiend. Unlike the other beasts we've encountered thus far, he is...intrinsic to this place.\nWhile I have tried to reason with him, it's been to no avail.\nI fear he may try to flee this place, but I will not allow that to happen.\nI'll not stand back and watch as this happens. I will go after him, and do whatever it takes to bring him back to this place.\nSo long as this mission continues, I'll keep you in my thoughts, as a friend. Till we meet again, Forename.", '\nPopmessage:', 'The enemy is still about!\nYou sense a hostile presence!']

Dialogue: ['\nMaucolyn:', 'Greetings, adventurer. I am loath to trouble you again, but I fear you have not been idle in your absence. The Order of the Twin Adder has need for an able ambassador, and I can think of none more suited to the task.\nOur contact in Gridania, Ser Marcelain, has been expecting you. Pray make your way to him at once, and he will brief you on the particulars of the mission.\nBefore departing, I must thank you once again for your assistance. I would not have been able to conduct this mission without your aid.\nI would also like to thank our allies, the Scions, for lending us their support. Your continued assistance means a great deal to us.\nI should also mention that your continued cooperation means a great deal to our organization. It is thanks to you, as well as the Scions, that our operatives can continue to carry out their duties in peace.\nI wish to thank you once more on behalf of the Order of the Twin Adder. It would not have been possible without your assistance.\nI will now brief you on the particulars of the mission. I will await you at the Adders' Nest.', '\nMaucolyn:', "Good.

I hope you don't feel put-upon by my conduct earlier. It was not my intention to cause you or the Scions any distress.\nWe are both duty-bound to convey the full extent of the mission to our allies. As you are aware, the Eorzean Alliance has been formed to address the region's myriad concerns.\nAs such, we have a presence in the Gridanian borderlands, both to provide for our own security and to lend our support to Allied forces in their efforts.\nIn order to facilitate these efforts, the High Command established the Bureau of the Twin Adder, a division within the Order responsible for trade and diplomacy.\nIts purpose is to strengthen the bonds between our peoples, and to foster cooperation in the face of any threat our nations may face.\nBefore joining the organization, Ser Marcelain served as a member of the High Command staff. As such, it is his knowledge of the inner workings of the organization which has allowed me to prepare this message.\nIt is my hope that

I don't know if they're related, but they're definitely out of the ordinary.\nI've been keeping my distance from the Order of Nald'thal for fear of getting involved, but I'd be much in your debt if you could dispatch a few of them.\nI'd hate to impose again, but I'd appreciate it if you could take down three of the beasts. You can take care of the others.", '\nTataru:', "I was worried that my decision would come back to haunt me, but...I think I'm ready.\nI was so relieved when Urianger came along that I didn't think I'd have the heart to leave him.\nIt's hard to believe that we got thrown out here to begin with, and we even had to abandon our post. But we managed to survive by the grace of the Twelve, so I don't think it's too late to turn things around.\nWe just need a little help from time to time. Right now, I'm thinking I'd like to meditate on the blessings of the wood. Maybe I can come back to the Scions and repay the debt we owe you."]

Dialogue: ['\nGullinkambi:', '\nThe kobolds have been driven from their ancestral homeland by a great wyrm. The kobolds now live in a variety of habitats across the realm. While some may see them as a nuisance, others see them as a valuable resource.\nThe kobolds are one of the many races and clans that make up the noble kobold tribe. While some may see them as a violent and warlike people, the truth is that they are a peace-loving people who love learning, and are always ready to learn more.\nIt is for this reason that the kobolds are so coveted by crafters, goldsmiths, and anyone else who desires quality goods.\nUnfortunately, the kobolds have been plagued by a number of troubles of late. Most troubling is the recurring─and quite severe─outpouring of acid rain. This afflicts crops and weakens crops. While it is not yet a problem in quantity, it is a worrying sign nonetheless.\nThankfully, the kobolds have made a remarkable recovery, and now number fewer than before. This is thanks in part to adventurers such as yourself, who have returned to their aid.\nUnfortunately, it seems we are once more faced with the threat of kobold aggression. Fortunately, we have fewer than before to deal with─but I fear that we are ill-equipped to deal with the problem on a large scale.\nI ask you to speak with our quartermaster to inquire into possible means of containing the beast. I will join you once I have completed my inquiries.\nI thank you once again for your aid. I wish you and your people all the best in your future endeavors.']
