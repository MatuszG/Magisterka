As you well know, our colony's survival is predicated upon the continued flow of nectar from the honeysuckle.\nBut I am pleased to say that in spite of the valiant efforts of the last two days, we are still far from being able to sustain ourselves.\nHenceforth, the hive will take its honey in turn from the honeysuckle. It is naught more than a temporary measure, but it is a necessary evil.\nYou, however, are not bound by the same constraints. Should the hive collapse at any point, the nectar will flow without limit. It would be a shame to let it go to waste.\nIn any case, I am pleased to see you are back and well-rested. You have my sincerest gratitude.\nI should mention, however, that my previous warnings were not idle. You should be aware that the nectar itself is not without its dangers.\nIn particular, be sure to watch your back should the hive collapse while you are gathering it. If the bees fall for the bait, the consequences are dire.", '\nPop:', '\nYou sense a hostile presence!', '\nKikipu:', '\nThe hive is no more! How did it manage to survive for so long?\nWell, I must say that your triumphant tone did not go unnoticed.

Thank you again for your assistance.']

You may speak with her there if you wish to proceed.", '\nLady Iceheart:', "Ah, Forename. My dear boy has made such a fuss over his new harp. It's called “The Harp of the High Rule Warriors,” and it's one of the most beautiful instruments in all of Gridania.\nI could scarcely believe my ears when I heard you would be joining me in bringing it to the realm...\nI've been blessed to have such a fine young lad to share my work with. I hope that our efforts to restore harmony to the Twelveswood have paid off in spades.\nYour harp, Forename, is an instrument of the wood, yes? It is a gift from the guardians of the Twelveswood, and its purpose is to aid us in channeling the aetherial currents flowing within our bodies.\nThe wood's aether is what gives life to our instruments. It sustains their performance as well as providing a source of amplification.\nThe guardians of the Twelveswood have gifted us with the means to do so, and we owe it to them to preserve their gift.\nIn this way, we are in constant contact with the aetherial currents flowing within us. This is the means by which we can summon the strength to perform our duties as woodwarden.\nWhen the guardians no longer need us to fulfill their role, we can return to our quietude and solitude.\nSuch is the way of it, I trust you to know.\nThank you for your continued cooperation, Forename. I shall see

Dialogue: ['\nVarthon:', "\nA friend of mine has a gift for me. It's something he made himself, and it's a gift of sorts─something that's both wondrous and dangerous.\nHe's worked tirelessly to recreate an ancient lyre, but he can't quite bring himself to release it into the world.\nI'm worried he's thrown his life away. I'm going to do whatever it takes to see this gift to him.\nBut I can't do it alone. I need you to help me. Bring me three vials of its blood, and I'll see that it gets to him.\nYou can find the lyre in the Forgotten Knight. Please hurry before it's too late.", '\nVarthon:', '\nThe lyre can be found in the Forgotten Knight. Please hurry before it's too late.', '\nVarthon:', '\nDid you bring the vials?', '\nVarthon:', "\nYes, these should be more than enough.\nYou see, the lyre was said to possess some sort of power that could grant even the most skilled performer great joy.\nHowever, the creator of this instrument could never have imagined that it would be used for evil.\nIt's a terrible shame, but it's clear that he will never get the chance to make something truly worthy.\nThat's why I've decided to use the lyre in its current state. It's an instrument of peace.\nI hope that, one day, it will be able to bring people together, and we can live a peaceful life together."]
