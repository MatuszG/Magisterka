Dialogue: ['\nDalric:', "\nI've found a new instrument for you, and it would seem you've caught my eye.\nIt's a bronze ring with a crystal set in the middle. A peculiar fusion of metals, if I do say so myself.\nMy research leads me to believe that these rings are used in some fashion to enhance the weapons of certain high-ranking soldiers.\nIn theory, if the weapon is sufficiently powerful, the user can create a bond with the weapon's crystal, granting it the properties of a blessed instrument.\nDalric believes that this unique property allows him to create weapons with truly terrifying capabilities. I must say, I find the idea intriguing, but I would be lying if I said I had a proof of its existence.\nBut I do─I have a prototype weapon in my possession, which you may see for yourself when you visit the Black Iron Bridge. If you should happen to have occasion to meet with Dalric in Ishgard, I would be most grateful if you could take a look.", '\nDalric:', "\nIt's been quite a while since last we met, and I hope that our time together has been beneficial.\nNow then, I would ask that you take my prototype weapon to the Black Iron Bridge and show it to Gundobald.\nIf the weapon proves to be anything like the prototype, he will be absolutely delighted to see it.", '\nGundobald:', "\nWhat's this? A prototype weapon?\nAye, it looks like Dalric's work.\nHe's been hard at work on this one, hasn't he? In fact, I can hardly wait to get my hands on it.\nI was told that the alloy used in its construction was of exceptional quality, and I'm pleased to say that it's even more impressive than I imagined.\nWhen I first heard that the Dusk Vigil had been converted into a weapon research facility, I had no idea that such wonders could be found in the Twelveswood.\nI'll be sure to keep my eye on Dalric's work in the future.\nOh, and if you happen to meet with Gundobald in Ishgard, I would be most grateful if you could take a look at his prototype weapon.", '\nDalric:', "\nGundobald is excited to see his work come to fruition!

You'll find it near the Holy Stables.\nI can't say I'm particularly keen on walnut lumber, but it's something of a specialty here in Thanalan.\nI'd gather some myself, but I fear the thought of working with walnut would scare away the creatures that frequent the area─the wood's enemies, in fact.\nWhich is all well and good, but I need the walnut lumber to be done in my stead.\nIf you could gather the walnut lumber in my stead, it would put my mind at ease.", '\nFufucha:', "\nYou've returned!

For a moment there, I was certain you had found a monster or some such.\nBut then I realized you were looking for walnut lumber.

I would have you inspect each of these items, and if possible, learn of its history.\nI trust you will find it both fascinating and educational.\nLet us begin with the flute itself.

It is said that, upon performing the ritual, the wielder was said to enter a state of transcendence, where he could commune with the elementals and perform deeds of power unseen by mortal man.\nThis was believed to possess a mystical power that surpassed even the might of the elementals themselves.\nIt is a curious fusion of both primal and element, which is what makes it such an important piece of cultural heritage.\nAnd yet, despite its cultural significance, we do not possess a single specimen of this tree, which would be an ideal specimen for studying its properties.\nThus, I would ask that you procure four pieces from the trees to the east of the Waking Sands, from which I believe you will be able to harvest a single branch.\nIt is an arduous task, but I am confident that you will succeed.", '\nAlphinaud:', '\nAh, you are back.
