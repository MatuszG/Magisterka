The matter of the ring, you see, is not one we should lightly discuss.\nIn fact, I think it best that you keep it between us. While it is not my place to pry, I would ask that you speak with my colleague Ser Joellaut─an esteemed blacksmith─to whom the ring is most closely held.\nHe should be able to provide you with the necessary information.', '\nJoellaut:', "\nAye, I'm Ser Joellaut, and if you're asking about the ring, you've come to the right person. I'm a blacksmith by trade, and my specialty is creating custom pieces for the wealthy.\nI was approached by a nobleman─not a member of the Dravanian Horde─and asked to forge a bespoke set of armor for him.\nThe armor was to be a gift from the House Durendaire knight to his mistress, a member of the nobility from another Dravanian faction. I had thought to forge the piece myself, but I've been asked to forge it for a client, namely the nobleman's manservant.\nI can only assume he was seeking a high-quality piece of armor, but I'm afraid I can't offer him anything beyond what I can provide.\nIt's rather ironic that the armor in question was crafted using the most expensive materials available. I doubt he would have chosen such an extravagant gift if he knew his funds were limited.\nWhat's more, he likely paid a great deal of money for it─more than he would have paid in Ul'dah, I'm sure. In any case, I'm not sure if I can help him, but I'll do what I can.\nI can hardly blame him─the armor is a masterpiece. I can hardly blame him─the armor is a masterpiece.\nBut I am not without pity. A man of his means would not be able to afford such an extravagant gift.\nIt is a shame, then, that he took the time to make the request in person. Had he simply asked me to forge a new piece, perhaps a better arrangement could have been made.\nI am pleased to say that I am able to fulfill his request─and for a small price.\nHe paid me in advance for what he paid for the armor. What's more, the nobleman has agreed to let me craft a new set for him.\nYou may be surprised to hear that I am also offering the armor to a member of the Dravanian Resistance─one of the many who sided with the Garleans during the Calamity.\nHe paid me in advance for what he paid for the armor. What's more, the nobleman has agreed to let me craft a new set for him.\nI had been considering whether or not to offer the armor to the Resistance myself, but after speaking with Ser Joellaut, I believe it's best to ask Ser Joellaut to help me craft it.\nI am honored to make the offer, and humbled to accept it. But I would ask that you not take my word for it. I would ask that you speak with Ser Joellaut to hear for yourself.\nAgain, I apologize for asking you to undertake this task on my behalf. I hope you will find it rewarding.", '\nJoellaut:', '\nI can hardly blame him─the armor is a masterpiece. I can hardly blame him─the armor is a masterpiece.']

It's called a “bargain hunt” and they've made a right mess of things!\n...Aye, I know what I'm talking about. It's not only the unbridled gall of the hunters, but the utter lack of tact and sensitivity in their approach. Not even the most seasoned of alchemists would claim to be unaware of the phenomenon.\nThis is where I come in. You see, I'm a─ahem, “chemist” in training. I've made some rather remarkable discoveries in my time, but I've no desire to spend my career chasing after gil-grabbled fools.\nThat's why I've taken the initiative to set about creating some new and novel bait for the hunt.\nI wanted something a little more distinctive than the usual assortment of worms and slugs. Something exotic, even. Something that─I mean, I don't know─might catch a hunter's attention. Something that might even provide the bait for a “bargain”!\nThe bait I chose was the pungent remains of a slain giant salamander. It's a rather nasty beast, and I didn't want it to get me killed, so I went to great lengths to ensure that I only used it in conjunction with the bait I'd prepared.\nI went so far as to obtain salamanders from the Isle of Bekko─one of the most remote and inhospitable of the isles─and then trapped and tracked them down to the Isle of Bekko itself. From there, I prepared a number of different kinds of salamanders, each of which I baited with a different kind of bait.\nI even prepared some salamanders that─I don't know─were mixed in with the bait I prepared. I baited them with these dried carcasses of a young giant salamander. Well, I'm sure you'll be curious as to how they did in the process.\nWell, I should be getting back to my post. Anyroad, if you find yourself in the area, I hope you'll come back and visit one day! It's been a pleasure, friend─and a lot of fun, too!"]

Perchance you are familiar with the situation at hand?\nA proposition for purchase has been made by a representative of the Steel Vigil.\nIt would seem that, having received permission from the Ironworks to construct a new armory, we have been asked to procure a quantity of steel ingots.\nFor this purpose, the Steel Vigil has negotiated a deal with an outfit known as the Carteneau Flats.\nThe price, you see, is steep, but the rewards are rich, if somewhat less so than initially anticipated.\nWe were, in fact, originally told that we would receive fifteen pieces of steel for placing our order. However, we were told that the total would rise to thirty, and that thirty pieces would be sufficient for a generous reward.\nNow, thirty steel ingots is a rather paltry haul, and yet our representative claims that it is worth the price.\nHe says that the Carteneau Flats are renowned for their quality. He claims that they can be found just to the north of here.\nIf you should happen to stumble across the Steel Vigil when you are on your way to Limsa Lominsa, I would be most grateful if you could pay the agreed-upon fee in advance.', '\nRafold:', '\nThe Steel Vigil is said to be a veritable behemoth of a manufactory, and the prospectors who frequent its gates are as numerous as the people who call the city home.\nWere it not for the presence of such formidable adversaries, we would never have ventured so far into the Twelveswood.\nMayhap the presence of the beasties has served to discourage would-be settlers from setting foot in the area, or at least made it difficult to procure any materials for the armory.\nIf the situation continues, I fear that the time may soon come when we are forced to consider a wholesale purchase of all manner of goods from the surrounding region.\nThat is why I feel confident recommending the Steel Vigil to my fellow members of the Order─those who might be willing to part with their hard-earned materials in exchange for the prestige and fortune that comes with owning a piece of Eorzea's finest.']

Dialogue: ['\nLyngsath:', "\nAh, Forename. It's good to see you again. I've been expecting you.\nAs you know, we've been working to develop a new kind of crystal which could revolutionize medicine.\nIts name is─crystals of the Resistance. They are a far cry from our previous attempts, but we believe they may hold the key to our success.\nThey are extremely difficult to create, and even the most talented jeweler cannot hope to match the skill of Master Lyngsath.\nBut perhaps you can succeed where he so ably did. I would like you to deliver a gift to my father, a man who is an authority in our village.\nHe is an alchemist by trade, and I am sure he would be pleased to receive it. Will you deliver it to him in my stead?", '\nAlchemist:', '\nOh, you have come at last. I have been waiting for you.\nI am pleased to see my son has come of his own accord. I knew he would come through.\nHe is a young man, and I have no doubt he will make a great contribution to our village.\nHe has, however, yet to decide on his future path.\nI would like him to ponder this matter when he arrives in the village.\nFor now, I would simply ask that you deliver the crystal to my father in my stead.', '\nLyngsath:', '\nI trust you delivered the gift my father was most pleased to receive?', '\nAlchemist:', '\nYes, this is indeed the key. My thanks.\nI shall make the most of it. My son has made a great contribution to our village, and I hope he continues to make a great contribution in the future.']
