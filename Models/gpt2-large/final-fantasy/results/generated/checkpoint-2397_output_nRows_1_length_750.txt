Dialogue: ['\nAlphinaud:', '\nAh, Forename─you are come at a good time. It seems our old friend Tataru has been hard at work devising a new strategy for the battle.\nIt is, quite simply, a gamble.

Your words have been heard.\nI believe we now have ample evidence to suggest that the main thrust of the strategy is to entice the enemy into committing to a large-scale assault on Ishgard itself.\nAnd in order to do so, we must weaken the defenses at key locations throughout the nation.\nI believe we are in a position to accomplish this objective in the near future. But I am loath to ask you to undertake such a perilous task alone─lest you be drawn into a conflict that you may die in your thousands.

I would very much like to see them before they are overrun by the Empire.\nIf we wait for the ruins to be overrun, we may never be able to conduct a proper investigation, not even if reinforcements are sent from the surface.\nI agree with Tataru's assessment that we must have every resource we can muster to finish this mission─resources that can be found only in Ishgard itself.\nI will have you begin mobilizing your forces for battle immediately. I hope the reinforcements will be able to help make up for any shortfalls.\nI will have you begin mobilizing your
