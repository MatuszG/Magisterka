This is due to the fact that it is based on the wishes of the people, rather than the dictates of the market.\nThough it sounds simple in theory, in practice it can be quite difficult to accurately predict demand.\nThis is why we have developed a new method through which to gauge interest in land.\nBy employing it, we can more accurately gauge the demand for land, and set appropriate prices.\nThough it sounds simple in theory, in practice it can be quite difficult to accurately predict demand.\nThus, I must urge you to practice this new appraisal technique.

Then I shall have to give her a little something.\nThe letter contains the results of our latest work.

The catalyst, as you may have noticed, is composed of a unique type of aether.\nThough the exact mechanism of the catalyst's effect on the aetherotransformer remains unclear, we believe it may contribute to the cores' shrinking.\nAs for why the catalyst is so special, it could be due to the fact that it was created using a unique type of aether. We believe this may be the reason why the cores seem to be shrinking at a faster rate.\nWe plan to proceed with the testing of this catalyst at the Aetherochemical Research Facility. Should the results of this research prove to be successful, we may have an aetherotransformer capable of even greater feats.\nWe would like nothing more than to see this catalyst put to the test, but as you are not Qina Lyehga, I am afraid we shall have to settle for demonstrating its effects on a few simple aetherotransformer cores.\nPlease, go to the Aetherochemical Research Facility and carry on your duties as Qina Lyehga.

Dialogue: ['\nKatering:', "\nI'm sorry, sir, but I need to borrow you an ampoule of my own creation. It's not much, but it should serve for a quick and painless delivery.\nI knew I could count on you. I've sent out multiple requests for the ampoule already.\nBut I've received yet another order for the exact same item, yet I know it will take me days to fulfill. I can't keep up with all of them!\nPlease, sir, if you can help it, would you please fetch the ampoule for me? It's in the storage area.", '\nKatering:', "\nAh, there it is. I knew you would make quick work of it.\nHere, take this. It's some form of a blessing that imbues the ampoule with divine might.\nIt's essentially a potion that will increase your martial prowess. I created it when I thought the gods themselves were too weak to handle the task.\nIt's quite potent, and I'm sure you've noticed the difference. The effect is quite instant, so don't be surprised if you run out of it before long.\nYou'll find it in the cabinet to the north. There's an ampoule recipe in it somewhere, if you're curious about it.", '\nKatering:', "\nPlease, I beg of you, go and fetch the blessing ampoule from the cabinet to the north. It's in the cabinet to the north.", '\nPop:', '\nYou sense a hostile presence!', '\nAccess:', '\nThe enemy is still about!', '\nKatering:', "\nOh my, that was quite a delivery! Thank you so much.\nI only sent out one request, but it seems I've been inundated with requests for the blessing ampoule.\nI'm sure you've noticed, but the ampoule is imbued with divine might. The amount of divine might depends on the kind of blessing used, but it's practically invulnerable.\nIf the gods are too weak, it will simply absorb all of the holy energy in the air. That's why they created it in the first place, to counteract such an eventuality.\nHowever, even if it is invulnerable, it cannot be used to craft any sort of weapon. No matter how strong your martial prowess, nothing will be able to pierce it.\nThe blessing ampoule is, essentially, an experimental creation. It's meant to supplement your already-excellent martial prowess, but it's too early to tell if it'll be successful.\nIt's an exciting time to be a Fuath, I daresay! All the more reason to learn all there is to learn!\nOh yes, I'm sure you have your own ideas as to what should be learned next. I look forward to hearing them!\nI hope you continue to support the Fuath and continue

Dialogue: ['\nHamon:', "Well, well...if it ain't my old friend Forename. I'd heard tell that you were a man with a gift for the wood, but to think I'd actually met you!\nWell, I'm here to say “Hello,” if you'll pardon the phrase. I'm a woodworker myself, but I'm also a dab hand at adventuring. So, what do you say?\nIf you're interested in meeting me, all you have to do is pick up my instrument. It's in a sturdy crate right outside, if you care to know.\nIt's a simple piece, but it's got more than its fair share of history behind it. I was once a student of the wood-crafting guild, you see, and one day I thought I'd bring some of what I learned to the people of Costa del Sol.\nBut even though I had a few ideas, I wasn't quite ready to commit to a full-fledged project. I was working on something, you see, but it wasn't quite ready to show the world.\nSo I gave it away─along with some of my other accoutrements. It was a bit of a jest, I know, but I couldn't bear to part with it. I wanted it to mean more to the people of Costa del Sol than I could ever hope to─\nWell, here it is. I hope it brings you joy. I'd like it if you could bring it to a friend of mine─a fellow woodworker─so that he might know what it means to work with his heart, not his tools.\nSo, what do you say? Would you be willing to give my instrument to a fellow woodworker?\nAye, that sounds like a fine idea. Here, take this for your troubles. It's a small token of my gratitude."]
