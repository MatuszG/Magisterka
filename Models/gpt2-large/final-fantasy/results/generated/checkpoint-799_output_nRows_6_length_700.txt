Dialogue: ['\nH'kha-H'kha:', "\nYou wish to know more of the history of the Twelveswood? I fear I cannot tell you much, but I will certainly share some of it with you.\nThe Twelveswood was the last settlement before the Flood, and it was a keystone for the settlement.\nIt was built upon the ruins of a once-great temple, the Temple of Raubahn, and it was the most beautiful structure in the Twelveswood.\nIn the temple's past, it was a place of worship, and so it is to be found in the ruins of the temple.\nThe temple's ruins are on the eastern shore of the island. If you would be so kind as to search the ruins for any remnants of the temple, I would be most obliged.\nAs you are already aware, the Twelveswood was once a hub for travelers. The people who settled there were the most civilized people in the Twelveswood.\nWhen the Flood came to the Twelveswood, they sent their children to live there. But when their children grew old and were no longer useful, they abandoned the place, moving to the west.\nThey were forced to leave the Twelveswood, and so they took the children with them.\nBut, with the Flood gone, the people of the Twelveswood decided to move to the land to the west.\nBut after many years, they were forced to return to the Twelveswood once more.\nThey did not want to return, and so they returned to the temple. The temple was abandoned for a long time, but it was finally restored by a man named Raubahn.\nHe was a man who had a talent for history, and it was he who came to the Twelveswood, searching for what he believed to be the ruins of the temple.\nHe was searching for the ruins of the temple, and when he found it, he said that he would not leave until the ruins were found.\nBut, it was then that the Flood came and destroyed everything in sight, and he was forced to leave the temple.\nBut, with the Flood gone, the people of the Twelveswood decided to move to the land to the west. But, with the Flood gone, the people of the Twelveswood decided to return to the temple once more.\nBut, with the Flood gone, the people of the Twelveswood decided to return to the temple once more.
