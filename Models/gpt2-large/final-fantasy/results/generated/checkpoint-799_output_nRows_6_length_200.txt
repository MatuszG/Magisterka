How can we hope to save these people?\nYou see, I'm thinking that we might have a chance of saving ourselves.\nWe're on a reconnaissance mission, you see. A mission that involves investigating the ruins at the site of the previous battle.\nIf I'm right, then the ruins have something to teach us.\nIf we could learn something of the past, we could perhaps find a way to prevent the next one.\nBut I don't think we should have to go back to the ruins to find it. If we just keep going, we'll never find it.\nIf we could find some ancient artifact or other, maybe we could find a way to prevent the next one.\
