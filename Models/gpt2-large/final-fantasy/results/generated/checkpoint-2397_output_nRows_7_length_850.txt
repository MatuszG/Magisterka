You were sent to retrieve a relic, and now you're threatening me for my weakness!\nYou...you're wrong! I was never intending to leave this place. I just wanted to make sure this weapon was safe before I left.\nI know this is sudden, but I need you to think on this for me. If you still wish to aid me, then there's still time for me to repay you.\nI'll leave you to it, Sergeant. You need to let go of your anger for a while yet."]
