They've got no business making such a mess of the place!\nI told them, “You're not welcome here.” That's the bloody truth, and I ain't done nothin' about it!\nYou see, the Calamity changed all of the animals on this island into beasts of the blood. Some of them, we can't even count how many. And all 'twouldn't be right if they started attacking people.\nAs much as I want to get rid of them, it's got to be done the old-fashioned way. But I've no one to blame but myself!", '\nCerutt:', "\nWell, ain't that a relief! I didn't think I'd be gettin' rid of 'em all by myself! Now, I'll get rid of the beasts before they start doin' any more damage!", '\nCerutt:', "\nAh, the beasts are gone! Thank you for that.\nAnd tell me, what did you think of my little idea? It was bloody brilliant!\nYou see, the Calamity was an eye-opener. It changed everything!\nAnd it was all thanks to those tools, that's why! Now, it's up to me to clean up the place and get back to work.\nNow, what do you think? Have you tried the tools I gave you?\nI know, I know! Why waste all this time and effort when you can go and get a hammer and start hammering away at those bloody beasts!\nWell, that's bloody brilliant! You needn't look so far to see the difference!\nWell, you've seen the bloody beasts, have you? They're not like to let you get away with what you've done here, so I reckon you should be able to get the job done!"]
