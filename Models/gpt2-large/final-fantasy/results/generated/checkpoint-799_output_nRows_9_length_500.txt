Dialogue: ['\nArtoirel:', '\nAye, it is I. Artoirel, the adventurer who has been with us since the beginning.\nI was recently tasked with organizing a banquet for the people of Ul'dah. But the task has been made more difficult by the fact that the banquet was scheduled to take place at the Grand Company Quarter.\nThe people of Ul'dah have no interest in the Grand Company Quarter. It is a place where they would rather not have their business, and it is a place they would rather not have their time.\nThere is no doubt in my mind that the people of Ul'dah would be most willing to listen to a man who had served with distinction. If you would be so kind as to assist me in this endeavor, I would be ever so grateful.', '\nArtoirel:', '\nIt would be most appreciated if you could attend the banquet with me.
