A receptive soul, to whom they can turn for help when they are down on their luck.\nIt is at times like these that I wish I could sit back and listen to the sounds of the wood. But I must stay focused on what needs doing. It is for this reason I created this instrument. I would be forever grateful if you could pass along the message I have for you.\nI have sent this message to a Voeburtite named Tatcha-Roi. Please hurry, as I fear he may not be receptive to the idea at first. If you would hear it from him, go and find him by the bookshelves in front of the Crozier. He may not be receptive at first, but I urge you to persistence.", '\nTatcha-Roi:', "Yes? Yes, I am Tatcha-Roi. I take it you've come seeking a sympathetic ear?\nHm? You've asked for my instrument

Dialogue: ['\nLionnellais:', '\nThe sultana has blessed us with a bounty of crops. A bountiful harvest, indeed! Yet, as you know, only the most fertile of fields are suitable for cultivation.\nSever the thorns and burn the boughs, but do not expect the land to yield its harvest on its own. Your efforts must be accompanied by a corresponding increase in seed production.\nIn this way, you and the sultana will co-create a rich field of crops that will ensure a prosperous future for the Qalyana.\nThe Qalyana are a proud people, and have long been known for their artistic endeavors. Though their fields are not the most fertile in Gridania, they do so with great regularity.\nIf cultivation is to be their profession, however, they must have access to the finest soil. And that means employing the finest of tools.\nI speak of the sultana's trusted instrument, the spindle. Used in combination with the harpoon, the spindle makes for a fine sledgehammer.\nUnfortunately, the Qalyana do not trust their instruments to be used in conjunction with harpoons. Why, if the sultana is to be the instrument, why is it that you are given this one instead?\nWhy, because I asked for it! Yes, yes, I do believe I asked for it. It is only natural that I would be the recipient of such a gifted sledgehammer.\nAs I mentioned, the Qalyana are a proud people. They do not trust their instruments to be used in conjunction with harpoon. Why, if the sultana is to be the instrument, why is it that you are given this one instead?\nWhy, because I asked for it! Yes, yes, I do believe I asked for it. It is only natural that I would be the recipient of such a gifted sledgehammer.\nBut forgive me if this question seems to be rhetorical. The spindle you see before you is the sultana's favored tool. It is her preferred hammer, and is used in conjunction with the harpoon.\nThough the Qalyana do not trust their instruments to be used in conjunction with harpoon, they still retain a fondness for the tool. It is just that their preferred

Dialogue: ['\nSeverian:', "\nA fine day it shall be to see you. I hope our guests have enjoyed themselves. I am glad to see that you are not too busy.\nWe have prepared a wonderful banquet for you, but I fear some of the provisions have yet to arrive. It would mean much to me if you could pick some up on our behalf.\nWe have purchased everything we need to prepare a feast for you. It is just a matter of gathering the necessary materials.\nPlease hurry, as some of the provisions may not arrive for some time.", '\nSeverian:', "\nDo not worry about us. All of the provisions are accounted for. All that remains is to obtain the necessary materials.\nPlease hurry, as some of the provisions may not arrive for some time.", '\nSeverian:', "\nAh, you have returned. Excellent! These are perfect. I will have to make use of them to make a magnificent horn.\nIt is a simple but effective tool. It is capable of slaying many a beast without effort.\nIt is a gift from my father, who passed away some time ago. It is a testament to his love for us.\nHe always made sure to mention how much he loved our children. It is a sentiment I have always been able to understand.\nI am proud to say my father continued to use his horn after he passed. He would often play it to us as we walked.\nIt brings a tear to my eye to see it, but I know it will bring us great joy to perform our father's legacy.\nI will take good care to ensure that it is passed down to my children. It is for this reason I wanted you to have it."]

Dialogue: ['\nArold:', "\nYou there! Can you help me?\nI need three dragon cores to repair my harp. They can only be obtained from highly esteemed collectors.\nI'd like you to bring me three cores from the lichyard in Westshore. You should be able to find the beasts lying dormant in the lichyard.", '\nArold:', "\nBring me three dragon cores from the lichyard in Westshore. You should be able to find the beasts lying dormant in the lichyard.", '\nArold:', "\nWere you able to get me my cores?\nThank you so much. I can finally get back to doing what I love.\nThis instrument is so important to me, I'm willing to die rather than sell it. It's one of my favorite things, the harp.\nI was just a poor boy when the empire invaded. I wanted nothing more than to go back and fight, but the war ended before I could finish high school.\nAfter that, I continued to study harp music, and eventually became a professional harpist. I even got a job at a tavern to support my habit.\nBut then the imperials came, and I lost my livelihood. I couldn't continue to practice what I loved. I had to give up on my dream.\nI was so angry I could do nothing about it, but then I met a man who said he was the same. He said he too wanted to give up, but he had to get back on his harp.\nHe convinced me to get back on my harp again, and this time, do it right. I'm a better harpist for his help.\nI owe him my life. Thank you."]

Dialogue: ['\nHierax:', "\nDo you have a moment? I require your help.\nI am in search of a particular goldsmith. He has a new creation that I am eager to try. However, I cannot do it alone.\nI would go myself, but I have been so busy of late that I have not had the time to visit him.\nIf you are willing, please bring me his newest work: an instrument that measures the gravity of aether.\nI will inspect it closely and make sure it meets my exacting standards.\nPlease, go to the Goldsmith of the Bazaar and speak with him. He will give you more information about the instrument.", '\nGolgsmithy:', "\nHow fare you on my test?\nOho, you've passed!\nAn excellent result, my friend! This instrument is sure to revolutionize our field of study.\nWe use it to study the effects of gravity on aether. The higher the density of aether, the stronger the gravitational pull.\nGravitational waves are the main source of data our research department uses when performing calculations.\nIn the past, we used different methods to determine the strength of aether. But with the advent of the Resistance, we decided to use the gravity gauge as our main source.\nThis method is still used in laboratories, but we plan to develop a more advanced version that can be used in combat.\nI am excited to hear of what you might develop in the future! I look forward to hearing of your discoveries!\nAnother outstanding instrument we are developing is the “iron maiden.” It measures the resistance of aether against aetherial attacks.\nThis will be of great help in improving the Resistance's research and creating weapons more powerful than before.\nIn addition, we are planning to construct a new research facility to the northeast of here. This will allow us to further expand our research and develop new weapons.\nIf you are interested in learning more, please come back and visit us again!\nOh, and if you have a moment, please do tell my lovely wife that we are blessed to have you as a husband and wife."]
