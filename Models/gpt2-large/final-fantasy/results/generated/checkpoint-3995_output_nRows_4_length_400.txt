When the song is over, I want you to go and fetch a bouquet of yellow roses from the orchards to the east. There you will find the roses, Minfilia will be waiting.\nPlease hurry! The sooner the better!', '\nThubyrgeim:', '\nDid you find the roses?\nOh, such lovely roses! I shall make an offering of them to Minfilia.\nPlease, take them to her.
