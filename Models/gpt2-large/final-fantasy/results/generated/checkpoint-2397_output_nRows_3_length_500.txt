Dialogue: ['\nMaucolyn:', "\nWell, if it isn't one of my good─ahem, good friends of mine.\nYou see, the one thing I'm not good at is crafting instruments myself.

To this day, the people of Namai continue to practice the ancient techniques of stringed music─and that is how you shall learn to play the bard's instrument.\nYou'll need the three pieces of aeria─a large horn, a small horn, and a small horn─to begin with.\nNow, the first thing you'll want to do is take these three pieces and put them together.\nNow, this is no jest. You will need some practice before you can play well enough to
