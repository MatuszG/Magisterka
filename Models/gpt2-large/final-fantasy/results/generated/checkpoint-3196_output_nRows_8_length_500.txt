Dialogue: ['\nWanderingminstrel:', "\nThe gods know I've asked for far too much this day, but might you help me?\nThe sylph elder I was speaking to earlier has a most peculiar habit of appearing before dire events. It's almost as if he's summoned a ghost from the other side of the world.\nI'm fairly certain he's referring to the adventurer who defeated the dread Shiva, you see, and who is now wandering about Costa del Sol.\nThe man was a hero in his day, one of Ishgard's most gifted alchemists. He was a founding member of the Company of Heroes, and one of its most esteemed members besides.\nHe died tragically in a shipwreck some time ago, and I've been trying to find him. I've been looking through old papers and other such things, but it's been a while since I had anything tangible to turn to.\nIf you could find him, I would be in your debt. He was an incredibly gifted alchemist, one of his countrymen even saying he was a living legend. I'd be a fool not to pay a little bit of a compliment to the man, would I?", '\nWanderingminstrel:', "\nThe captain of the Costa del Sol alchemical company? I've searched high and low, but I've failed to find him. At this point, I'm sure he's wandered into the North Shroud, off on his own somewhere.\nThe captain was a brilliant alchemist as well, one of his countrymen even saying he was a living legend.

Costa del Sol's only alchemist.\nI lost my dear wife recently, and I've been in search of her. I've been looking through old papers, but I can't find her name anywhere. Do you think you could check for her in my place?\nI'm fairly certain she's somewhere in the North Shroud. If you could check for her in my place, I would be in your debt

Dialogue: ['\nEadbert:', "\nYou look like you've seen a scrap or two. Mind helping me with a bit of a problem?\nI was looking around an abandoned house and came across this iron brazier. It's set on fire right now, but I can't seem to get it to burn itself out.\nIt's the only thing I have that can save me from...well, everything. But I can't leave the brazier unattended for any amount of time. So I need you to go in there, and put out the fire.\nIt sounds like you're not one to shirk your duties, but I'm worried something might have happened if I'd gone off by myself. Would you be willing to go in there for me?\nI'll make it worth your while, though. Here, take this. It's some of the gold I found when I was looking around an abandoned house. It's a small fortune compared to what I made from selling off my entire harvest, but it will buy me time.\nI can't believe I even asked you to help me. You're too kind, even though it means you'll have to help me again. Here, take it."]

Dialogue: ['\nErik:', '\nForename! I hear you've been busy. Work, work, work─ever so busy. I swear, if it weren't for my son, I'd have bought him a drink and let him play with the dolls!\n...But it is good to talk to you. I hope you are able to help me with my research.\nYou see, when Ishgardian scholars first arrived in Costa del Sol, they found that─much to their surprise─the local fauna exhibited all manner of bizarre behaviors.\nIt was thought that the arrival of these so-called “savages” had unleashed a primal within the fauna, one that could only be slain by our brave men and women in the field.\nThat's why, for generations, the Costa del Sol professors have conducted research on these so-called savages, collecting samples and analyzing them to determine their nature.\nOne of my sons, however, has been quite insistent that I send him off to Costa del Sol to complete his studies on behalf of the guild. He says it's important for us to know what our new neighbors are like, so he's been putting forth a large amount of effort.\nUnfortunately, he has been quite irritable of late, and has been unable to focus. I worry for him, as he is my only child. Please, would you go and speak with him for me? He is likely to be quite irritable if you do not respond.\nThank you. He should be back at the house soon. He is a very hard worker, and deserves a reward for his efforts.\nPlease, go and reward my son for his hard work. He deserves it. He works long and hard for the pleasure of the people of Costa del Sol, and deserves a reward for it.\nPlease, speak with my son once more to thank him for his hard work. He deserves it.', '\nErikson:', '\nForename! I hear you have been busy. Work, work, work─ever so busy.

I was hoping you might come along.\nI'm a quartermaster for a tavern run by an adventurer, and my shift starts soon.\nI've been thinking of how to make use of all the healers here at the Adventurers' Guild, but if I don't make enough from my own work, I'll have to rely on them for work.\nI've been looking around the Adventurers' Guild, and I've noticed that there's a volunteer here who can help with the healers. Would you be willing to pay him a visit and see if he might be able to spare a few gil?\nI'm sorry to ask this of you, but could you come to the south of here and speak with this man?

You see, I've been having a difficult time finding anyone to fill the void left by the healers' absence.\nA number of them have been working tirelessly to keep our tavern running, but they are starting to run out of fresh air.\nIf we don't keep the healers on, the smell of disinfectant and the patients' coughing will become unbearable. I worry that without their help, we will have to turn to the dangerous alchemical concoctions our patients are forced to drink.\nI had hoped you would come along for this task, but I fear I cannot ask for your services if you are already so busy.
