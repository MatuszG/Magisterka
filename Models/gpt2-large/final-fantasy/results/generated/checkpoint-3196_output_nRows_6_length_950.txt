Dialogue: ['\nBraya:', "\nWell met, adventurer. I'm Braya, a gleaner for the Order of Nald'thal. I hear tell you're a man of some skill. I could certainly do with a hand.\nYou see, I'm looking to fill a void in my knowledge. I'm an avid follower of all things arcane, and I'm always on the lookout for new theories and research.\nI've set my sights on a particular area of research, namely the primal─or what's left of it, at least.\nWhile there's still much we don't know, it's enough to get me started. I'd be grateful if you could take a look for me.\nIf you could scour the ruins for a primal, or at least take note of its physical form, I'd be in your debt.", '\nBraya:', "\nIf you find a primal, or at least note its physical form, I'd be in your debt.", '\nBraya:', "\nWell? What did you find?\n...Oh, I see. Very well. Let us proceed.\nAs you might expect, the primal is shrouded in mystery. As a gleaner, I'm never one to shy away from a challenge, but I've never even come across a theory as unorthodox as this.\nA theory so bold that it defies explanation! For a gleaner such as myself, this is a dream come true! I'm going to put my considerable skills to work uncovering this theory, and I'd be most grateful if you could help.\nI'm hoping to draw together a wealth of previously unexplored knowledge, but I can't do it all myself. If you could take on a few of the more outstanding theories, you would be more than welcome.\nHere is a summary of the most outstanding theories I have thus far. Please, take it and spread it around.", '\nBraya:', "\nI'd like you to take on a few of the more outstanding theories I have thus far. Please, take it and spread it around.", '\nBraya:', "\nAh, a few theories have already been dealt with? That's wonderful to hear! With any luck, we can wrap up our work here in no time at all.\nI had a mind to finish my work here, but I've received word that a traveler may have stumbled across one of the key pieces of evidence. Would you be willing to go and investigate in my stead?\nIf you're willing, I'll meet you at the spot where the key piece of evidence was found. Please come back and let me know if you find it.", '\nBraya:', '\nIf you find the key piece of evidence, please bring it back to me. I will finish my work here.', '\nBraya:', "\nIt's been a while since I last heard from you. I hope you didn't find the evidence as exciting as I had.\nThe rumors I heard─that a traveler had found the key and brought it back to me─seems to confirm my suspicions.\nBut I'm not sure what it means. Have you ever heard of the Allagan Empire? They're a military empire that rose and fell during the Age of Strife.\nThey maintain a unified system that includes the military, the imperials, and the heretics.\nTheir leader, however, is rarely seen, and is thus referred to as the Emperor.\nThey are, by and large, a peaceable nation that puts the welfare of their people first. Even so, they have been subject to some amount of meddling by their neighbors.\nIn fact, the recent skirmishes with the Empire have served to escalate things.\nI'm sure you've noticed, but the Order of Nald'thal is constantly in need of researchers and adventurers. We can't keep doing our jobs without them.\nSo if you can spare the time, I would greatly appreciate it. I'll see to it you get paid for your efforts."]

Dialogue: ['\nBriardien:', "\nAh, Forename. I trust you have been keeping abreast of the latest developments at Rowena's House of Splendors?\nI will not pretend that our arrangement with House Durendaire is any less beneficial than others, but our participation in the Triple Triad─and the resulting entanglements─is not to be borne.\nYou see, the House of Splendors, like all House Durendaire families, is embroiled in a constant struggle with the “other side”─the “House of Splendors.” I say this because, as you well know, our noble house has long been the foremost manufacturer of armor for the Allied forces.\nThe Triple Triad, by contrast, is concerned with the advancement of technology, and has thus been at perpetual conflict with our esteemed house.\nOur house has been forced to enter into mutually beneficial agreements with our adversaries, lest we lose our technological edge.\nAlas, in our efforts to maintain favorable terms with our adversaries, we have been led to engage in conduct which could be considered...inappropriate.\nFor instance, during the annual exhibition to celebrate the House's sultana's sultanaization, representatives from both Houses were invited to attend.\nAlas, for reasons unknown, our esteemed house sponsors a display featuring equipment imported from foreign countries, while our representatives from the Triple Triad are barred from participating.\nIt is, in short, entirely within the rights of the House of Splendors to exclude our representatives from the exhibition. But, as you well know, it would be in our best interests to maintain favorable terms with our adversaries.\nSo, while “inappropriate” in nature, what is done is done─and I shall leave you to it, Forename.\nNow, let us return to the matter of your recent visit to House Durendaire. I trust you are aware that, as a gesture of goodwill, the sultana has requested that we supply them with artifacts?\nHmmm...if I may, I would like to propose to you a variety of items for this purpose.\nPlease speak with Genna at the aetheryte in East Hawkers' Alley. I would be most grateful if you could procure these artifacts for us.\nAlas, I know little of these objects, but I have been told that they are of interest to the researchers at the aetheryte. I have been asked to inform you as much. Please make your way there, and speak with Genna.", '\nGenna:', '\nWelcome back, Forename. By your return, I take it you have learned more of our sultana's artifact request.\nVery well, we will consider it a “gift” from the sultana, but we will not be making any promises of compensation.\nIf you would like to know more─perhaps as a token of our goodwill─I would ask you to visit the aetheryte in East Hawkers' Alley. I will be most grateful if you can procure any of our artifacts for us.', '\nGenna:', '\nI will be most grateful if you can procure any of our artifacts for us.', '\nGobelin:', '\nGreetings, sir. Is there something you require of me?\nAh, Forename─the sultana has asked that we procure artifacts from foreign lands?\nI am hardly an expert in such matters, but I would be happy to assist her in her research.\nYou will, of course, be compensated for your efforts.\nPlease do be sure to convey my gratitude to the sultana.', '\nGobelin:', "\nI will be most grateful if you can acquire any of our artifacts for us."]

I have a task that needs doing.\nYou see, I'm supposed to hunt a certain aurochs─a favorite of Azem─but I've yet to even catch one.\nI've tried reaching out to the local hunters, but they refuse to do anything. They simply say they cannot spare the aurochs, and that it is too dangerous.\nI realize this is sudden, but please, I need you to track one down on my behalf. I would go myself, but I cannot bear the thought of having a wounded auroch on my back, screaming in pain.\nPlease, track down aurochs and bring back their meat.

Thank goodness you came.\nI thought I was done for...\nI was hunting a species of auroch that is unique to this region. They are incredibly dangerous, however, and I was worried the aurochs I was hunting would be too much for one so new to this world.\nHowever, I have been proven wrong. I now know that it is possible to hunt these monsters. I now understand why the hunters refuse to work with me.\nYou, on the other hand, look like you can handle a beast of your own. Do you have what I need?', '\nHardened Hunter:', "\nYes─this should be enough. Thank you.\nI hunted these aurochs for so long that they grew so accustomed to me that they would sometimes attack without warning.\nHowever, I am learning that not all aurochs are created equal. Some are born with terrible traits, like the savage aurochs that attacked my friend.\nI no longer fear these beasts as I once did. Thank you for saving him."]

Please, go in my stead.\nI'll start with a question. What is your name?\nForename? Oh, Forename! I've always thought of you as a clever and dashing lad. What brings you here today?\nAh, yes. I was under the impression I was to be meeting a fellow recruit. I'm sorry to trouble you for such a routine task, but I'd be ever so grateful if you could tell me more about the mission.\nI'll begin by asking about the location of the camp.

For instance, you could─\nHm. I'm not sure I should tell you this, but─\nI would advise against trying to scale the cliff. It's not as straightforward as you might think.\nYou'll need a bit of a strategy, though─one that requires you to be constantly on your guard.

You can find the targets by the north gate.\nI've marked the locations on this map. Make sure you practice enough so that you can hit them when I mark them.\nOnce you've learned the basics, I'd like you to try your hand at some of the more difficult tasks.
