Will you help me look?", '\nRoroton:', "\nI'm pretty sure I know the answer to that. You'll find the answer in the village to the west.", '\nMogmont:', '\nRoroton, you are returned! How did you fare in your search?', '\nRoroton:', "\nHmm... Well, I must say that the horns you've brought me are much more interesting than the usual fare.\nThey are not only different in appearance and sound, but they are also quite different in function. They are used to tame beasts, for instance, and are imbued with magical properties that allow the user to alter their properties.\nI can see why my son is so excited by them

To that end, I've been researching how best to make the most of the locally-born cuts, and I've come across a rather remarkable discovery─one that may revolutionize the way we feed our carnivores in the years to come.\nNow, I know that many of you are eager to try your hand at this, but I'm afraid you're still in the very early stages.

It's made with tender, juicy chunks of local meat─think about it: the more meat you can wring out of these tender chunks, the better the flavor. And, if you're worried about getting your hands dirty, worry not─I've already got some pretty good lard on hand.\nJust toss it in the crockpot, and within a day or two, you'll have a hearty meal that's sure to please even the
