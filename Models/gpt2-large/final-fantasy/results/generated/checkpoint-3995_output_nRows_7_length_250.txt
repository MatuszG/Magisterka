Yet I've heard no mention of him actually slaying a fiend...\nIf there is truth to these rumors, he should be at the airship landing. Let us hurry, Forename. The sooner the Resistance knows for certain that Hien is not lying, the better.\nI've already sent word to the Resistance, asking them to gather at the airship landing and await our arrival.\nI realize this is sudden, but might I trouble you to take a look inside?

And though there have been some indications that they may surrender, I find myself doubtful that they will do so willingly.\nIt would be in our best interests to free them, but to do so will not be easy.\nI will not be party to the negotiation, but if there is anyone who can be trusted to do so, it is you. Pray speak with Gibrillont, the warden, to learn more.', '\nGibrillont:', "\nSo you've been working with the prisoners for some time.

They continue to demand ever more outrageous and ever more draconian terms in exchange for their submission.\nAt this point, I fear that no alternative will be viable. We must remain vigilant, Forename, and make every effort to ensure that the Ixal do not succeed in their mission.\nNow that you are officially our belligerents' newest comrades, I am certain you will want to take a few days off from your busy schedule to join us in the plaza.
