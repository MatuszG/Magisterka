Might you have a moment?\nA friend and I are planning a trip to the Crystarium, but we don't have the right kind of materials to craft with.\nThat's where you come in! If you find a few vials of karakul mist and some karakul horns, we can make a fine perfume.\nThe perfume is made using a blend of karakul mist and horn extracts, and it should be quite effective.\nIt's a bit of a gamble, but if you can bring me enough of the stuff, it might be worth your while.", '\nMogret:', "Once we have enough of the stuff, we'll be able to make a perfume that'll last a long time.\nIt's a bit of a gamble, but if you can bring me enough of the stuff, it might be worth your while.", '\nMogret:', "Ah, you're back! Were you able to find any of the karakul horns and the karakul mist?\nThe horns are just over there. And the mist is over there. Both should be ripe for harvesting, I think.\nThank you, friend. It's been a long time coming, but here we are.\nI'm sure you'll want to try it for yourself. It might not be for everyone, but I hope you'll find it enlightening!"]

How might we be of service to you?', '\nKarnes:', "\nI am pleased to make my acquaintance, Blade Surname. As it happens, I was hoping you might come along.\nI am Karnes, a retainer stationed at the Observatorium. I take it you have heard of its workings? It is a facility for studying the physiology of living things, and our work has focused on how they adapt to external stimuli.\nAs such, it is no surprise that our most recent arrivals─Eschiva and her retainer─were both fascinated by the moon's light and keen to explore its beauty.\nTheir curiosity led them to believe that they might discover new worlds through its light─and I believe we have done our part to stimulate their interest.\nOur latest arrival, meanwhile, was hoping to learn more of the moon's inhabitants, and I am pleased to say that we have made progress in that regard.\nShe claims to have encountered a variety of creatures in her time here, and I am pleased to say that she has provided us with useful information.\nI would ask you to pass along my report to my colleague here, but I would rather not burden you with my every thought.
