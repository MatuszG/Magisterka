Dialogue: ['\nAlphinaud:', "I must confess, I was rather taken aback when I heard that you had met with some success. That you were even able to secure a foothold in the disputed territories... It defies imagination.\nMayhap you are unaware of my previous engagements, but I was once a member of the Foreign Brigade. I served in the West for a number of years, during which time I honed my skills as a soldier and earned promotion to the rank of captain.\nAfter the Calamity struck, however, my duties took me back to Ishgard, where I served as a brigadier until I was transferred to the Foreign Brigade.\nI remain proud to have served my nation in battle, but I must admit to some disappointment that our efforts to win back territory from the imperials had to come to naught.\nIn fact, it was precisely because of our engagements with the Empire that I was demoted to the rank of captain.\nWhile I am proud to have served our nation in service to our homeland, it has robbed me of the opportunities that were available to me prior to the Calamity.\nIt is for this very reason that I have decided to devote my time to research and development of the Resistance weapons.\nThough I have made great strides in my endeavor, there still remains a long way to go before I can bring my weapon

Dialogue: ['\nRafold:', "\nAh, Forename! I was hoping you'd come along.\nThe Brass Blades are in a tight spot. A recent skirmish with the Vanu resulted in several of our soldiers being wounded. I would go directly to the source─the wounded─and ask for their aid, but I fear I'm not quite ready. I'd rather do it myself, but I'm not entirely reliable.\nThat's where you come in. I need you to go to Camp Skull Valley, and there treat the wounded. When you're done, come and let me know.\nI would go myself, but I cannot leave the Brass Blades' headquarters. It's too dangerous.

I trust your preparations for the mission have been well received?', '\nAlphinaud:', 'Aye, I fear Ser Liausteren's assessment of our chances is most apt.', '\nLaniaitte:', 'I do not mean to suggest that we are doomed to fail, but we may yet be swifter than the wind in our pursuit of our objectives.', '\nAlphinaud:', 'But forgive me, Forename.

I would welcome any adventurer willing to brave the harsh environment of Vylbrand.\nThe journey here is long and arduous. It would not do to have an adventurer crash land on our doorstep. That is why I have prepared this bag of supplies.\nI will ferry you across the lake and deliver them to you. If you would, however, wait a moment, I have something else I would ask of you.\nI would be ever so grateful if you could gather the courage to stand atop the cliff at the very top of this ridge and look out over Lakeland.\nI will await your arrival.\nWhat say you?", '\nDrest:', "\nThere you are.
