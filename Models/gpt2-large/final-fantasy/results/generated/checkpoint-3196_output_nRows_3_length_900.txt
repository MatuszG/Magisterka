And so I decided: I will give up on being the best and go and become a pauper.\nBut I was too ambitious. I wanted so badly to become famous, so much so that I tried to become a pauper so badly. And it backfired.\nSo I decided to give up on being a pauper and try to become a famous pugilist. And now I am a famous pugilist.\nBut I am too ambitious. I want to become a famous pugilist so badly that I spend all my time training, and then nothing else. I am a pauper!\nSo I have been training to the point that I am practically unusable. I need help, though. I need someone to help me practice my techniques so that when the time comes for me to challenge Gaius, I can still defeat him!\nI need you to go and find my brother, Erik. He is currently training to the west. I want him to see me practicing my techniques so that he can prepare himself!\nAnd I need you to tell him: do not be a pauper! I will defeat you!", '\nErik:', "\nWhat is it? You've gone and done the right thing by telling him?\nI'm glad to hear it. I am grateful for everything you did for me.\nI never imagined I would be pauper material, but having you around has helped me immensely. I am more confident in my abilities than ever.\nI would like you to have this─a little something from me. It's for showing your gratitude. It's not much, but I wanted you to know."]

Nyunkrepf was impressed by the young lad's bravery, and vowed to help her find her lost love.\nSo, they began to search for each other, and eventually found each other in Costa del Sol.\nIt was there they began to share a life that was unlike any other. They met again in Costa del Sol, where they both dreamed of having a family of their own.\nAnd so, from there, they began to work together to find the perfect family for their love, and in the end, found it in Costa del Sol.\nThat is why, in Costa del Sol, they placed a wreath on each other's heads to remember their dear friend.\nAs you can see, I have a lot on my plate, but please, I need your help to finish this song!"]
