I have always respected the elders and their wisdom, but I have never dared to speak my mind.\nThat changed when I heard that the Admiral had made a decision─to expel all the villagers from the isle.\nI was heartened to see that the Admiral did not mean to expel us all─only those who committed heinous crimes. However, it is what we have chosen to do that has me most worried.\nI know that many of the villagers are innocent and that my words may not sway them, but if I cannot even convince them to speak out, then how am I to earn their support?\nMy father would be heartened to know that the Admiral's decision was not made lightly.
