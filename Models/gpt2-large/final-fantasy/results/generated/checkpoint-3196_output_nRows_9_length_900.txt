As they get older, their hair grows longer and their eyes get bigger.\nSome children are born with blue hair and others with red. This is because their parents were exposed to different light as a child.\nThese properties also play a role in how they are treated when they are born. Some are born with certain traits that are passed down from parent to child.\nFor instance, if a child is born with a vision that is especially rich in green, it is likely that they will receive the best education.\nThough it is not strictly true, it may be said that a child's personality is influenced by the color of their hair and the lessons they were exposed to as a child.\nOf course, not everyone experiences these same things, and it is through such experiences that a person grows.\nAs an example, let us consider the color of a person's soul. Children are born with a certain amount of it, which increases as they get older.\nAs they get older, this amount of their soul begins to shrink. Thus, they become less sensitive to the things that make them unique.\nAs an example, let us consider the color of a person's gender.

I am ever glad to see you pass through the Seventh Heaven with purposeful stride.\nYou see, in your absence, I have been studying the histories of ancient Ishgard, and I believe I have a most pertinent question for you.\nYou see, in the days before the Calamity─and possibly even before─there were thriving cities scattered across Lakeland.\nCities such as Ul'dah, Limsa Lominsa, and Gridania, to name but a few, were bustling with life.\nOf course, the Calamity changed all that. The once-vibrant markets and bustling streets have all but disappeared, and we Ishgardians know it.\nStill, it is important to remember that not all of Lakeland was destroyed in the Calamity. Much of it remained in Ul'dah, for example, where there was a thriving port and a thriving merchant district.\nIt would be a mistake to decry all of Lakeland a lost cause. Ul'dah still boasts a vibrant economy, and Limsa Lominsa is thriving as well.\nBut the loss of so much of our nation's wealth is something that must be compensated for. And I believe that your assistance will be instrumental in accomplishing this.\nIn cooperation with our merchants, we have established a new “respite”─a place where we Ishgardians can go to regale ourselves with tales of the past.\nTake this bottle of nostalgia, for instance. I've reserved it for you. Imagine the tales you can share with your fellow Ishgardians, and the memories they will cherish!", '\nPop:', '\nYou sense a hostile presence!', '\nAlys:', "\nYes, the memories will surely make the most beautiful wine you've ever tasted.

The rich deposits there attracted many a wealthy nobleman to settle in the area.\nIt was during these years that the great powers of Ishgard met, and the peace between our peoples flourished.\nHowever, a terrible war broke out, and the Allied forces won the battle. After a short while, most of the settlements on both sides were lost.\nAfter the war, the Allied forces set about reclaiming what territory they had lost, and eventually established the modern nation of Ishgard.\nIn fact, Lakeland was among the first to be liberated, and it flourished under Allied rule for a time.\nHowever, in the decades following the Calamity─and possibly before─there were many villages and towns that were destroyed by the Horde. The survivors turned to each other for support, and a thriving merchant community developed.\nIt is my hope that this small but vibrant settlement will be able to preserve its history for future generations.\nAnd thank you for helping to set my mind at ease. Here─a small token of my thanks."]

Welcome to Snowcloak, where the art of war once flourished!\nAnd now, for the first time in forever, the people of Snowcloak shall be afforded the chance to look upon the works of renowned artistes of the past! Yes, yes! Yes!', '\nWanderingminstrel:', "\nThe Final Days have made some remarkable changes to Gridania. One such change is the appearance of the local wildlife. No longer are the beasts seen as mere beasts of burden, but rather a vibrant variety with a distinct way of life.\nThis is a species that was once confined to the frigid climes of the North Shroud─an ice-dominant species once confined to the far reaches of the ice-covered central highlands. However, the Calamity changed all that, shifting the balance of power in our favor. No longer can such species thrive in a world without ice.\nIt is for this reason that some believe the creatures will not only return, but thrive in the absence of ice as well.
