In fact, the barrier is so effective that even feral bees have been deterred from approaching the new hive.\nThe beeswax barrier was built to the southwest of the original hive, to the northeast of its current position. To the northeast of that location are the ruins of two ancient ruins─one an underwater ruin and the other a land-locked ruin.\nIn the ruins are the remains of ancient beekeeping techniques─a knowledge the beeswax bears the hive's future. Should the beeswax be lost, the entire perimeter of the new hive would be rendered uninhabitable to bees and all manner of wild creatures.\n...But that's not all. The beeswax impregnable wall was constructed to protect the hive itself, and to that end the beeswax was genetically altered to become a more aggressive specimen.\nIn addition to possessing a higher level of aggression, the beeswax has been given the ability to sting more frequently. Should the beeswax be lost, the new queen will have a field day striking down her previous brethren.\nIn short, the hive has been tasked with protecting itself.
