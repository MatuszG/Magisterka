Dialogue: ['\nGullinkambi:', '\nGood evening, Forename. I am pleased to inform you that the Eulmoran Resistance has agreed to a deal.\nUnder the terms of the deal, the Eulmoran Resistance will hand over three prisoner-of-war prisoners in exchange for the freedom of Ala Mhigo.\nAla Mhigo is a largely agricultural nation, and its people have long struggled to make a living in the post-apocalyptic wasteland.\nAlthough the number of refugees has greatly increased in recent years, many still live in poverty. Thus, keeping the peace is one of the main priorities of the Eulmoran government.\nThe prisoners in question are a pair: a man named Uto and a woman named Ala Mhigo.\nUto was born in Ala Mhigo, and Ala Mhigo was her home until she was taken prisoner by the Empire.\nBoth Uto and Ala Mhigo were found not far from their home in southern Thanalan, and are currently being held in captivity by the Garleans.\nIt is believed that they were taken during a skirmish with the Resistance in northern Thanalan some time ago. It is also believed that they fell into a trap set by the Garleans.\nI do not know how long they have been held in captivity, but I imagine they have been there a very long time. I would like nothing more than to visit them, but my travel plans prevent me from doing so.\nAs a gesture of goodwill, however, I would like you to offer my cellmates a warm meal in return for their cooperation. I should like nothing more than to be on my way.\nPlease make the delivery to Cid. I will see that the food is delivered to Ala Mhigo as soon as possible.', '\nCid:', "\nWelcome back, Forename. I take it you had no difficulty in completing the delivery?\nIt's been quite a while, Forename. I'm glad to hear that both Uto and Ala Mhigo are now in our thoughts.\nThe Resistance has long been concerned with preserving the peace in southern Thanalan. As such, it was not unexpected that we would come across Ala Mhigan refugees in our search.\nWhile we cannot help them completely, we can play an important role in helping them adapt to life in the post-apocalyptic wasteland.\nI'll go ahead and tell you more about what we can do.\nIn addition to providing for their basic needs, we are working to develop their skills so they can enter the fields of agriculture and fishing.\nAnd I'm sure you've heard us mention fishing before. It's a key part of our nation's economy, and one that we intend to encourage.\nI hope you enjoyed hearing about our work! Now, let's talk about how we can make you a better soldier!\nI knew you were keen on joining us, but I never expected it would be so easy.\nFirst of all, you'll need to prove you're not a coward. Take this test: imagine facing an enemy who would destroy you if given the chance.\nIf you can manage to survive that battle, I'm certain you'll make a fine member of our Resistance.\nBut before that, there's the matter of your food. After I give you the details, I want you to try feeding some of our prisoners.\nI'll explain everything in due course, but make sure you try feeding some of our prisoners before you decide to join us.\nWe can't give everything to you─it's a matter of priorities, after all. I hope you'll make the right decision for you."]

I am honored to have such a capable young one as you under my watchful eye.\nKujata was a terrible creature.

Thank you again for continuing to help us.\nPlease, head to the Morning Stars and speak with Mogoon.']
