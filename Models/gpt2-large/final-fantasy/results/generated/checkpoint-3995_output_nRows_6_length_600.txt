Dialogue: ['\nDuvicauroix:', "\nHello there, traveler. I'm working on my report for the day, and I have a favor to ask of you. I'm looking for a runaway child, you see, and it would be a shame if the little one were to end up in the care of a beast.\nI would ask you to seek the child in question in the Brume, if you're able. I should note, however, that if you do manage to locate the child, I would ask that you provide it with a warm blanket and a warm meal.\nI realize that this may seem like a trivial matter, but as I said, I'm sure the child will be more than a little taken care of once he's caught by the carers.", '\nDuvicauroix:', "\nWell? Were you able to find the child?\nWonderful! Thank you! The boy is a ward of House Fortemps, and they've taken good care of him.\nThe ward has been fed and clothed since he was taken into their care, and as far as I know he's been receiving regular visits from both his parents and the Fortemps' attendants.\nAs a matter of fact, the boy's mother was even able to make her way to the Brume to pick up her son at the orphanage a short while ago. I imagine he's been doing well there.\nIt's not every day one finds a ward of House Fortemps in the wild. Most of them end up in the care of the Dutiful Sisters, but there have been a few who've found their way to the opposite camp.\nEither way, thank you for making the journey. I'll be sure to give the boy your patronage when I receive word of his safe return."]
