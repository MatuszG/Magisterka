Dialogue: ['\nZlatan:', "\nAs we speak, the Seventh Sage is preparing to summon the final element─Bahamut's lightning.\nThe process is not unlike that which occurred with the previous avatar, when the Scion of the Seventh Dawn used a crystal to bind the elementals of the seventh and final astral tier.\nWith the current avatar, however, the ritual will require the use of a crystal of unparalleled power.\nTo ensure their success, the Scions must needs procure crystals from the other three heavens─the four great crystals of the Azys Lla, the four great crystals of the Sagolii Lla, and the four great crystals of the Ziggurat Lla.\nThese crystals can be found in the possession of the Ul'dahan noblemen who once held the titles of landlords in the Near East, as well as in the hands of the Ul'dahn mages who once served as the landlords of Ul'dah.\nAnd, as we have already explained, the summoning of the elementals is an essential part of the process.\nThe crystals, however, are not the only thing the elementals desire. They also seek to commune with the Seventh Sage, who in turn desires to commune with the aetherial currents of the Twelveswood.\nIn the past, the elementals used these aetherial currents to commune with their guardians, but they have since grown disenchanted with their role as landlords. Thus do they turn to the elementals for guidance once more.\nIn the interests of efficiency, the elementals have asked that you deliver this crystal to the Seventh Sage in the western highlands of Ul'dah. You will find her in the central highlands of Coerthas, at the location where the elementals first gathered in the form of a great tree.\nIn accordance with the elementals' wishes, you will also be required to wear an aetherial barrier while you deliver the crystal.\nShould you die while in the process of summoning, the elementals will take your body and reassemble it at the location of your death.\nYou may return to the Seventh Sage at any time to request another crystal, provided you have not yet fully recovered from your injuries.\n", '\nZlatan:', '\nShould you die while in the process of summoning, the elementals will take your body and reassemble it at the location of your death. You may return to the Seventh Sage at any time to request another crystal, provided you have not yet fully recovered from your injuries.', '\nZlatan:', '\nI see... I believe I understand. You will be needing this crystal again, yes?\nThen please, take it to the Seventh Sage at the highlands of Coerthas.', '\nZlatan:', "\nYou've returned! And with a newly found crystal of unprecedented power.\n...Hm? You wish to ask us for another crystal?\nI see... I believe I understand. You will be needing this crystal again, yes?\nThen please, take it to the Seventh Sage at the highlands of Coerthas."]

I trust you have learned something of the essence of our art.\nIn the ancient days, the wood of the sylph was considered holy, and instruments of that wood were prized as sacred objects.\nIn the days of yore, the only way to acquire one of these precious instruments was to perform a sacred ritual.\nIt was said that after a certain number of years, these sacred instruments would be given to the worthy among us.\nAnd thus was our tradition beginning, that those who could perform the most sacred of rituals would be blessed with these instruments.\nSuch was the way of things until the advent of the Seventh Umbral Era, when the elementals took control of the forest and began to wreak havoc upon it.\nThe sylphs' sacred instruments were no more, and so we were left to gather what was left of them, and make our way as a people with our tools.\n...But now that the elementals have been banished, we must turn to you once more for aid.

You'll have to do your own investigating to find out what's gone awry.\nI would also ask that you keep an eye on the crystal markets─the creatures that drop them are more numerous than you might expect, and they're not hard to miss.\nWith that in mind, I ask that you visit the Crystarium in eastern Thanalan and speak with Yozan, the proprietor.

Dialogue: ['\nDmitar:', "\nSo good to see you, Blade Surname. My commanding officer has told me all about your valiant efforts at the battle of Castellum Velodyna.\nHe also informed me that you and your comrades have done a commendable deed for the cause, and that you would soon be receiving an honorable mention from the Order of the Twin Adder.\nI would see to it personally that you were made privy to this most treasured of honors, but I fear that my duties have prevented me from attending to my duties in person.\nIf you would be so kind as to escort me to the Rosehouse, I would be most honored if you could do so in my stead.", '\nDmitar:', "\nMy commanding officer awaits me at the Rosehouse.", '\nDmitar:', "\nThere you are, Blade Surname. I trust you have attended to your duties at the Rosehouse?\nA shame, but I am relieved to see that you are well.\nYour courage and valor on the battlefield were truly inspiring. To think that you would meet with the same reception at the hands of our Order─it bodes ill for our cause in future endeavors.\nI must say, I am honored to have been able to witness your battle firsthand. To think that you would face an enemy of such formidable strength...\nMy commanding officer bids me give you a fitting reward, Blade Surname.\nAccording to our records, this particular specimen of a Velodyna─Vorsaileheuloix's personal creation─was last seen in the southern reaches of Vylbrand.\nWhile it is common knowledge that the beast has been sighted far to the north, its exact whereabouts are shrouded in mystery.\nTo complicate matters, the beast in question is a creation of the Holy See, and it cannot be slain using conventional means.\nIn order to acquire the means to do so, the Velodyna's creator, the Archon, has petitioned the aid of a master of the black arts─an alchemist.\nHe is said to be stationed at the Velodyna Biomass Research Facility in the Velodyna Archipelago.\nAccording to our records, the alchemist is currently in the process of synthesizing a new type of crystal known as a “volyn crystal.” These crystals are essential to the alchemist's work, and have been entrusted to you as a token of our appreciation.\nYour reward, Blade Surname, is a fitting token of our appreciation. I hope you will accept it with the sincerity and good faith that you so richly deserve it."]
