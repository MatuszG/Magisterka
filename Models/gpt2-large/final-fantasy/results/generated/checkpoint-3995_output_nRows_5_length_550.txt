It was his duty to keep the sultana safe and sound, and it was to his grave that you have rendered the nobleman's soul ere he breathed his last.\nIn a time when the Sultansworn are synonymous with strength and might, it is heartening to see that they continue to hold on to their ideals, even in the face of hardship.\nIt is for this reason that I would ask you a small favor of my own. While in the city, I was approached by a man who wished to discuss a potential partnership. Though I had no intent to offer him my services, I was nevertheless pleasantly surprised to find that he was a gentleman of considerable means.\nNeedless to say, I was keen to have the man introduce himself to me, so I paid him a visit at the Gorgagne Mills.\nThe man was a Moorish merchant named Isaudore, and he was eager to make the acquaintance of the Azure Dragoon. Though I had little reason to doubt the man's words, I nevertheless took the liberty of requesting that he introduce himself to the Azure Dragoon.\nHe was, alas, not so kind as to grant me an audience. Frustrating as this was, however, I nevertheless decided to avail myself of the opportunity.\nI then met with the merchant at the Gorgagne Mills, where he was adamant that I be given an opportunity to purchase land and settle down here in Ul'dah.\nNot long after that, the Sultansworn themselves informed me that the Azure Dragoon had died.\nI am now at liberty to purchase land and make a name for myself that is not already occupied by a member of the Sultansworn. I will endeavor to make Ala Gannha a place where even the least among us can enjoy the comforts of home.\nThank you for your kind words, Forename. I will endeavor to make Ala Gannha a place where even the least among us can enjoy the comforts of home."]

How did you fare?\nSo it is true what they say─the kongamato are not to be trifled with!\nWell, they are not much more than small birds, but a well-aimed arrow can send them into a frenzy for all I care!\nThis area is much more dangerous than the one to the north.

No, he is a warrior possessed of unflagging stamina and a ferocity to match.\nAnd today, he faces a foe far surpassing anything the Scions have faced to date.\nHis foe is the Dravanian Horde, a force to be reckoned with by any measure.
