But then he changed his mind.\nHe no longer trusts you, Forename.\nBut that is not the worst of his suspicions. He has also begun to suspect you of being...notherworldly in your dealings.\nSo much so, that he has even begun to doubt your abilities.\nAnd that is why he has asked for you to come to the House of the Fierce.

I have a favor to ask of you.\nI'm planning a trip to the Hammers in the near future, and I need a quick and easy way to transport my wits.\nIf you're at all familiar with the place, you've no doubt noticed the brambly contraption at the end of Rowena's path.    It's a beeautiful plan, as I've been told.\nWhy, just look at this─the thing's as big as a house and has been going round and round outside the gates of the city. I'd go myself, but I've got too much to do here!\nWould you mind setting the bumblebee's backside down at the entrance to the city? I can't leave without it.\nHere goes nothing!", '\nLuciane:', "Just look at the size of that thing! And the way it's moving... I don't know how you do it!\nThat's the end of Rowena's path, in case you've forgotten.\nOh, you're back. I hope all went well.\nApologies for subjecting you to such a silly test, of course.\nThe truth is, I've no idea how you do it. I've only seen you work on the hilt and in the workshop, and from what I hear you're quite the capable sort.\nBut I daresay a fellow marauder who knows a thing or two about such matters could provide you with some assistance. I doubt I'll have need of such a test, though, so pray accept my humblest thanks for your assistance!"]

The couple traveled to Ul'dah where the archbishop was born.\nWhile in Ul'dah, the archbishop fell in with a society of wealthy Ul'dahians. They had high expectations for him and his family, but he was anything but.\nAfter a time, the wealthy Ul'dahians grew to despise him. They began to send their servants to take his place. But the archbishop would not be ignored. He remained in Ul'dah and rekindled the friendship between the two families.\nIn return for his loyal service, the servants gave him gifts ranging from jewelry to vegetables. But all was not sweetness and light.

But above all, he was beloved by his wife. They raised a family together and provided for their child.\nWhen the archbishop was made archbishop, his wife asked him to return home to Ul'dah. He did not hesitate to do so.\nBut in the intervening years, they had a son together. And while they continued to give generously to the church, they also began to show signs of strain.\nThe archbishop was heartened to hear that both he and his son were in fact still in Ul'dah.

Dialogue: ['\nJehantel:', '\nAh, Forename. I trust you are enjoying your atma–infused relic?\nOf course you are! But to what end? What is the purpose of this device, if not to grant succor to our fellow man?\nThe scriptures tell us that, “When the hand of man is joined to the soul of a holy instrument, it brings the soul of the giver unto the realm of the gods.”\nAnd thus we choose our instruments of worship with care, for they may be the means by which we communicate with the gods.\nToday, I would share with you an experience I had while conducting research into the atma.\nI was examining a piece of historical parchment which, through some trick of the atma, became both holy and mortal. While it was still upon my person, a dark figure appeared, and within moments, I found myself possessed of the power to banish the being.\nThis is the story of how Manu, the first of the gods, was cast down into the sea of chaos. His spirit, however, took up residence in the atma, and it was there that he wrote the words “He who bears a blade of sharpened steel, Who holds a holy song in his hands.”\nThis device, Manu's atma, is the weapon of his choice when he seeks to summon his divine kin. Indeed, it is said that, “When the hand of man is joined to the soul of a holy instrument, it brings the soul of the giver unto the realm of the gods.”\nManu, the first of the gods, was cast down into the sea of chaos. His spirit, however, took up residence in the atma, and it was there that he wrote the words “He who bears a blade of sharpened steel, Who holds a holy song in his hands.”\nAh, Forename, as you can see, the atma is an instrument of power. Indeed, its purpose is to channel the power of the soul, so that we may in turn, commune with the gods.\nAnd though this knowledge was given to us in the form of an atma, it is not our only means of divinity. There are others, however, such as our dear friend Forename, who utilize other means of transmission.\nAs you may have gathered, there are myriad atma which allow us to crystallize our individuality. Each is, in its way, a gate between worlds, and each is, by its very nature, sacred.\nWell then, to what end do you intend to attach the atma to your relic? Do you intend to use it to banish your evil nemesis? Should you choose to do so, pray pray do so with utmost care, for its power can be wielded to good effect.\nWell then, Forename, I pray that your atma will bring you and your vessel safely to the other side. May it serve you well, and may it bring you good fortune!']

I ask you to seek him out at the Kohm Noskh, in the Outer Circuit.\nI am in your debt, Forename.\nAs you have no doubt heard, a number of years ago, a young Padjal attempted to seize the power of the Kohm Noskh. He was slain in the process, and his spirit sealed within a gaol.\nHowever, a number of years ago, a Padjal of our order was murdered in the Kohm Noskh. His killer has never been found, and so we have been left with no choice but to perform the ritual ourselves.\nIt is a difficult and time-consuming task, but we have no choice─the life of the Kohm Noskh is at stake.\nTo complete the ritual, we must use the only instrument capable of performing the deed─a blessed instrument. And by choosing to use one of the many offerings at our disposal, we shall be safeguarded from any future harm.\nThere are, of course, certain stipulations which must be observed. Our dear friend was a child of the Twelveswood, and we cannot allow his soul to be separated from ours.\nBut even should we be able to perform the ritual without his aid, it would be far preferable to having him continue to live. So I ask that you seek him out at the Kohm Noskh in the Outer Circuit. I shall be along shortly.', '\nKohm Noskh:', '\nYou have come. Very good.\nNow then, the question is: how do we use this blessed instrument?\nWe begin by gathering eight white lilies.

This will allow us to access the soul of the deceased.\nFinally, we kneel and offer the flower to the Kohm Noskh. Our wish is that their soul will be granted peace, and so we ask that they allow us to perform the ritual eternally.\nThere you have it, Forename.\nYou have performed the ritual as we asked. It is time that you took it up.\nPlease return to me the next time you wish to perform the ritual. I shall be along.', '\nKohm Noskh:', '\nHow do you fare?\nYou have performed the ritual as we asked.

I could tell from the look on your face that you agree with me.\nNow, I would share with you an idea that I have had in mind. I've written it down, in case you are the one who decides upon its realization.\nTo wit, I ask that you visit the guild and play the harp there.

I trust you had enough food to last us for the time being?\nJust as I was! Thanks to you, our storehouse is now able to function as we intended. You have my thanks!"]

Dialogue: ['\nHirase:', "\nAh, my de─ Oh, not here to deliver a message! I'm here to thank you for your kindness, and share a bit of my life with you.\nI was recently approached by an elderly gentleman─oh, must be you─who wished to speak with me. At the time I thought nothing of it, but now that I've caught wind of it, I'm worried sick.\nIt's a small step to take, but I fear the man may not realize he's being observed. Please, will you go in my stead?\nI can think of no better a person to ask than you, so if you could meet me at the Gosetsu Guesthouse in Kugane, I would be forever in your debt.", '\nHirase:', '\nPlease, I beg of you! Would you go to the Gosetsu Guesthouse in Kugane, and meet with an elderly gentleman?', '\nOboro:', '\nI was looking for you, Forename. I was told a distinguished-looking individual was seen in the eastern mountains, and I feared it was you.\nI was only too happy to go and confirm what a handful of others had already told me─that you were indeed in the area. And what a pleasant surprise it was to meet with you!\nYou must be quite busy with your many tasks. I was under the impression you had just arrived.\nOh, our paths have crossed many times─I even served in the same barracks as you. But to think I would be the one to introduce you to someone like you! I will remember this well.\nI will also keep in touch with how you fare. I can think of no one better to share my knowledge with.']

Dialogue: ['\nJantellot:', "\nI'm pleased to see you've returned. What news?\nThe sylph elder has arrived in person! I can scarcely believe it!\nThe elder has been wanting to meet you for some time, but my requests for the time being have been denied.\nIt's all well and good that he wants to speak with you, but why he hasn't decided to do so himself is beyond me.\nI suppose I can hardly blame him. Traveling the world and meeting so many different people is never easy, and I'm hardly a first choice.\nI suppose I just...I just wanted to be with him. I just wanted to tell him... <sigh> I just wish I could do more. I just...I just want to tell him...\nPlease, you have to help me. I just...I just want to tell him... <sniffle>"]

Title: A Blissful Arrival
Dialogue: ['\nMarielle:', "\nWelcome back, Forename. I take it by your triumphant expression you've already set forth on your journey to Woven Oath.\nOf course not! As I suspected, one of your newfound comrades─not to mention a capable and resourceful one─is Rowena's younger sister, Dellexia. Dellexia herself was a master of the bow, an archer to be reckoned with, and it would be no exaggeration to say that she is the equal of your mentor in skill and experience.\nBut to arrive at this juncture is hardly an accomplishment to be celebrated. Dellexia herself acknowledged as much, saying that she was merely fulfilling her destiny as a daughter of Ishgard.\nIn fact, it would be more accurate to say that Woven Oath is where the genesis of your art took place. Rowena herself was there to provide the framework for your development, guiding you from the moment you set foot on the mat.\nIn fact, it was her unwavering support for you and your training that made you the archer you are today.\nBut your art is far from a simple one. For you must master not only arrow technique, but also the use of other weapons─blade, spear, and rod.\nYou must also strive to deepen your understanding of the elements─fire, earth, and the like─that make up your art's foundation.\nIt may not be easy work, but if you love the art as much as I do, you will surely find your way back to me.", '\nMarielle:', "\nIf you mean to devote yourself to your training, then you need only peruse the contents of my private collection.\nGo on, now─purchase anything from the list I've provided and return to me when you're done.", '\nMarielle:', '\nGo on, now─purchase anything from the list I've provided and return to me when you're done.', '\nMarielle:', '\nGo on, now─purchase anything from the list I've provided and return to me when you're done.', '\nMarielle:', "\nWelcome back, Forename. Dellexia was eager to hear of your progress.\nIn fact, she was so eager to hear of it that she nearly broke the item she was examining. Luckily, I had it in me to catch her.\nIt's of no consequence, but I thought you might like to see it in person. You can find Rowena at the entrance to the village─it won't be long before you're able to find her as well, I'm sure.\nDellexia will be proud to see you continue to develop your skills, and I hope you'll continue to admire her as much."]

I am charged with making the acquaintance of foreign dignitaries, so it is only fitting that I make the first stop on your tour of Doma.\nIt would not be possible for me to attend to all of your needs on my own, so I would be most grateful if you could seek out my counterpart in the House of the Fierce. I should be able to accommodate your needs at that establishment.", '\nCirina:', '\nMy counterpart in the House of the Fierce will be more than happy to accommodate you at their establishment.

After the shock of seeing you in my homeland, I daresay I'd forgotten all about you!\nYou must be quite eager to meet our guest. He is a man of great importance, and it would be a shame to keep him waiting.\nIf you would indulge me, I would be most grateful if you could take this tub of warm water and sprinkle it about the room.\nIt is only natural that after a journey such as this one, one would become acclimated to one's new environment. I think it would be well for you to take a bath whilst in the city.\nThere is no better way than a bath after a long journey. Now if only I could convince the House of the Fierce to let me keep you for longer!", '\nCirina:', '\nMy counterpart in the House of the Fierce will be more than happy to accommodate you at their establishment.

I am ever glad to see one as keen as you pass through.\nYou'll be pleased to know that the ferry that brought you here can carry goods as far as the Praetorium.\nWhy not let your appetite for adventure take you there? The last wagon was full to bursting, and there's still some stock left to be picked over.", '\nMarielle:', "\nOh, I don't mean to rush you!

Well, let me just say that I'm glad you made it this far!\nThe ale I sent you is made using a blend of local ingredients, and it's sure to have your palate tingling.\nBut tell me, did you also find the sights and sounds of Ul'dah quite...comforting?\nI know, I know, I know. Well, I'm sure that once your stomach's forced its way back, you'll be back here, singing the praises of Quicksand and saluting your flag. Till sea swallows all!"]
