Dialogue: ['\nAlphinaud:', '\nAh, Forename. You are come at a most opportune time. I have a favor to ask of you.\nI am in your debt once again. Perchance you have heard the rumors, but I fear that these latest sightings may be the work of a band of outlaws.\nTheir leader, dressed in black robe and armor, was last seen making his way from the Senaculum Imperialis to the Senaculum Austerorum. He is a man of great repute and, if true, would be an important figure in the restoration of the House of Ul.\nI would have you travel to the Senaculum Imperialis and investigate the matter with my men. If it turns out to be true, I would be most grateful if you could recover the robe and armor.\nYou will find the Senaculum Imperialis just below the Senaculum Austerorum. I would have you search there.', '\nPop:', '\nYou sense a hostile presence!', '\nAlphinaud:', '\nHave you recovered the black robe and armor?', '\nAlphinaud:', '\nMy word, everything appears to be accounted for. This is, of course, only hearsay, but I have every confidence that the Garleans will not be far behind.\nYet while this is indeed a momentous day for House Haillenarte, it is also a momentous day for Gridania. For our part, the House will live on, but our victory will not be as simple as that of our enemies.\nFor some time, I feared that our defeat was inevitable. Yet here is a chance to set the record straight. If our enemies are to be defeated, they must be defeated. And by setting the record straight, we have done just that.']

Dialogue: ['\nKohl Ahleh:', "Well met, adventurer. May I interest you in the services of a retainer?\nAh, yes. A man of your talents could not have come at a more opportune time. I have an urgent matter to attend to and need someone to assist me.\nI was recently approached by a man who I suspect is an associate of mine. He was demanding an exorbitant fee for a job that should be performed with nary a pause.\nI declined the request, of course, but he claimed that the task was too urgent and that he would be ready at a moment's notice. I suspect he means to meet me at the Wheiskaet.\nI realize this is sudden, but would you be so kind as to procure the ale for me? It's the least you could do.\nThe man will be waiting for you at the Wheiskaet, just as he was when first I approached him.\nAh, and before I forget, I should mention that this exclusive deal requires that you deliver the ale in my stead. I don't care who you are or what you've done, as long as you make me happy.", '\nKohl Ahleh:', 'Bravo! You are indeed the esteemed “Swift” I've heard so much about!\nI have no doubt the swiftness of your wits will prove an asset when dealing with my associates.\nI can think of none more suited to the task.\nThis bottle is empty, but I dare not take it to the man for I do not trust his taste in liquor.\nInstead, I would have you deliver it to a friend of mine. That is why I requested you employ this “swiftness” of yours.\nIt will be delivered to a friend of mine. Please see that it reaches him in time for the “afterparty.” It goes without saying that I will not be present.', '\nNpc:', "Hail sinner well met, adventurer.\nWhat brings you to my humble abode?\nThe ale!

I should be able to rest easier now.\nOh, but before you go, allow me to ask something of you. Would you be so kind as to accompany me to the Wheiskaet?\nThere is a secluded area just beyond the gates where you are to meet with our clients.\nI would not recommend going there alone. Take care, and don't go falling over.", '\nNpc:', "I wouldn't recommend going there alone. Take care, and don't go falling over.", '\nAhleh:', 'Welcome back. I trust the transaction went smoothly?\nThe swiftness of your wits was truly impressive. Your payment was as agreed?\nI had no idea! I shall have to repay the favor somehow, but I am pleased to know that you were able to fulfill your side of the bargain.\nNow, what was it you wished to discuss?\nAh, yes. I believe I caught a glimpse of the client at the Wheiskaet.\nThat he wishes to meet with you at the Wheiskaet is no coincidence. As you've no doubt observed, he is an associate of mine and it would not surprise me if he were to approach you at some point in the future.']

If it's not, though... Well, you may be surprised to learn that I require a single competent adventurer to perform a simple task: slay a certain number of cedar goobbues.\nIf you've seen any in your travels, you know that the creatures are quite difficult to track down. You might try speaking with a local hunter or wandering minstrel, but they'll most likely lead you right to their traps.\nIf you can handle the task on your own, I'm certain you can handle the rest.", '\nMerlzirn:', "\nSlaying a few goobbues shouldn't be too taxing a task for a capable adventurer such as yourself. And don't worry─I take pride in seeing my clients' belongings safely to their hands!\nSo what do you say? Do you see the goobbues I sent you to slay?\nYou're looking quite formidable, indeed! I had a feeling you would prove a capable adversary.\nI've had dealings with the creatures on more than one occasion, and I've come to learn that they pose a threat not only to our merchants, but to our entire nation.\nThe time has come for us to put down this menace. All that remains is the payment.\nI would be most appreciative if you could deliver this to a man named Sundhimal in Revenant's Toll. He's the man who will be receiving the goobbue meat.\nSundhimal can be found at the Octant, to the east of Revenant's Toll. You can pay your respects by taking the path west and slaying any cedar goobbues that come your way.\nAnd while you're there, give my regards to the man who will be paying your respects. I'll be waiting!", '\nSundhimal:', "\nA message from Merlzirn? Aye, I heard.\nI'm Sundhimal, the man who will be paying your respects. You may pay your respects by taking the path west and slaying any cedar goobbues that come your way.\nAnd while you're there, give my regards to the man who will be paying your respects. I'll be waiting!", '\nMerlzirn:', "\nYou've returned! And with the goobbue meat, I hope...?\nAhhh, such a delectable offering. Let's see what else you've got to say about it...\nWhat's this...? Why, this is...\nWhy, this is...<gasp> Why!?\nE-Excuse me, I shouldn't ask. I mean, yes, I'm certainly glad you made it, but... <sigh> It's just... I mean, it's just a little too easy to get carried away when dealing with these creatures.\nI suppose I can't force you to work for me, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't looking forward to learning more of your adventures. And if you ever have the opportunity to make me a deal, I'd be most grateful if you could take it.\nI'll be waiting. And I hope you enjoy your time in Revenant's Toll."]

Title: A Bargain Struck
Dialogue: ['\nCibleroit:', "\nAh, Forename! It's good of you to come. There was a dispatch here from Camp Drybone some time ago─from the commanding officer himself!\nThe officers thought the kobold to be too small, weak─not strong enough to take on the full might of the Flame General. But to my great embarrassment, they were proved wrong! The kobolds now pose a threat to the safety of our garrison─and to the peace of the region.\nYou see, word has it that the Flame General has a private army of kobolds under his command. And though our own knights are trained to repel a kobold attack, word has it that they are ill equipped to take on the full might of Flame General Raubahn.\nYou see, word has it that the Flame General has a private army of kobolds under his command. And though our own knights are trained to repel a kobold attack, word has it that they are ill equipped to take on the full might of Flame General Raubahn.\nI would be grateful if you could deliver this letter to Lieutenant Gavin at the Hall of Flames in Ul'dah. That man would be in contact with the garrison and would be able to give you further instructions. Do point him in the direction of Lord Francel, as you would do him the honor.", '\nGavin:', '\nAh, Forename! It is good of you to come. The officers spoke of your prowess to their peers. I have no doubt that you are capable of cutting down a beastman or two.\nBut to assume that a mere knight can vanquish a primal is to misunderstand the nature of the beastmen we seek to slay. The kobolds you seek are those of the deepest darkest recesses─those which the ancients called upon the Dark Divinity to banish.\n...And you will do well to make your way to the deepest recesses of the Flame General's domain. The kobolds you seek are those of the deepest darkest recesses─those which the ancients called upon the Dark Divinity to banish.']
