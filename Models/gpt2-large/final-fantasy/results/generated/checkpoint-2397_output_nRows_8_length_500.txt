Dialogue: ['\nThibaut:', "Well, now that you mention it, I did see something in the air while you were out there.\nSomething primal─if I may?─that you may have encountered in your time out there.\nI'm certain that I saw a winged serpent─or perhaps two, if I'm reading these ancient texts right.\nThat would be the primalsong, wouldn't you agree? It was slain by our great wyrm, long ago, when the great kami ruled the seas.\nThat's not to say that the beast wasn't powerful─it was, after all, the embodiment of chaos and destruction. But the true nature of the beast changed when the great kami fell, and it began to transform into something more...beastlike.\nSome say that the beast eventually turned into a bird, and that it flew to the moon to lay its eggs there. It was a curiosity at the time, but now that we know what it is, I think it's more likely that it flew to the Isles of Umbra.\nThat place, as we know it, is the favored destination for the Children of the Everlasting Dark, who worship the primalsong. It would make sense that the beast there was transformed into something more...beastlike, in turn.\nIt is, however, highly unlikely that the Children would wait for such a transformation to happen, for they would never allow themselves to be caught in the middle of it. I think you may be safe here for the time being, though."]
