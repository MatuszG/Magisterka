I am responsible for keeping the peace in this area─keeping people from coming to harm, as it so happens.\nMy duties have led me into close contact with many adventurers, but I have yet to meet a man who is not thoroughly immersed in his work.\nI am reminded of the “Warrior of Light,” for whom many a tavern song is dedicated. While I can appreciate the sentiment, I must admit to a certain boredom from time to time.\nIf you are up to the task, I would have you patrol the area in search of those who seem to be in a dour mood.\nI realize that this may seem like a trivial matter, but it would give me an opportunity to meet people from outside my own realm. You will find that most folks are quite welcoming─even if they do not share my interest in the wonders of our world.\nIf I might make a suggestion, you might also consider making use of the facilities here at the Wonders. There is a storehouse to the south, containing wares that are of interest to adventurers. You might also consider visiting the Adventurers' Guild if you wish to learn more.\nIf you wish to know about the Wonders, I suggest you first speak with the security officer in charge.

I am told you have a knack for making excellent first impressions.\nYou have a knack for making excellent first impressions, I'll give you that. It would seem you have also gained some experience dealing with “rash beasts,” which is a rather apt description.\nThe “rash beasts” that plague the Wonders are a collection of vicious creatures brought about by a fault in the creation of the “Greatwood,” an artificial intelligence created by the Allagan Empire to administer and protect the Greatwood.\nThe “rash beasts” were originally created to provide an adequate number for the “Warrior of Light,” but they quickly grew out of control, devouring everything in sight in their ever-increasing appetite for destruction.\nThankfully, a number of measures were taken to curb their growth, but in the end, no matter how effective they were, they were too much for one man to deal with alone.\nSo, as a gesture of goodwill, we worked with the Allagan to develop a solution to the problem. We dubbed it the “compact war machine,” and it was first introduced into service during the final stage of the War─after which it was taken over by the military and used to destroy any threats to the peace.\nBut, as you are no doubt aware, we are no longer in any position to aid you in your quest. As such, I must ask that you seek alternative means of acquiring information. I am sure you will find some use for what you have brought me.\nI also urge you to be cautious when approaching anyone you think might be an ally of the Resistance. Make sure to make inquiries only through our normal channels. I hope to see you again soon."]
