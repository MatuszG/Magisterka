Dialogue: ['\nAlphinaud:', '\nThe agreement reached between the Eulmoran and the Ixal was a good one, but the price was steep.\nIt was not so much that the Ixal surrendered their most prized possession─the Crystal Tower─as that they were forced to surrender their most valuable resource─the Carteneau Flats.\nThe Eulmorans made an example of Carteneau, forcing the Ixal to relinquish their territory in exchange for protection. This was not so much a surrender as a forced surrender; the Ixal had no choice but to acquiesce.\nBut the price was steep, indeed. Carteneau was stripped of its defenses and reduced to a handful of ruins.\nIt is no exaggeration to say that the destruction of the Crystal Tower and the loss of the Flats will have a profound effect on the Carteneau Flats.\nIt is for this reason that we have been working feverishly to restore the ruins to their former glory. Alas, our efforts have been met with fierce resistance─the arrogant Ixal callingously denying any part of their territory to the Carteneau Flats without the slightest provocation.\nBut we have not been idle in our pursuit of our objectives. We have made significant inroads into the Ixal stronghold network, completing several tasks that should prove effective tools of attack.\nThe House Durendaire knights are the proud guardians of the order's interests. They will not surrender their weapons to a foreign power willingly, but the price is surely steep.\nWe must press on, however, to purge the ruins of their Ixal defenders. To that end, we have sent word to Master Garlond of the plan.\nI would be grateful if you would aid us by capturing a few of the Ixal in the process. I should imagine that the task would be made easier by having some enemy at your back.\nI would also be grateful if you could report to Ser Marcelain at the Adders' Nest. He will know what to do.', '

Dialogue: ['\nMeffrid:', "\nWell, this is a pleasant surprise. I'm Meffrid, a merchant who represents the interests of the Adventurers' Guild here in Gridania.\nYou're here at last! I've been expecting you.\nYou see, I've been negotiating a contract with a foreign merchant for the purchase of exclusive weaponry.\nHowever, the man refuses to accept the terms I've laid out, and in the middle of our talks a masked man jumps out of the shadows and starts swinging swords.\nI daresay he has something to do with the masked man. I pursue him down the street, but he evades my blows with ease. Eventually I have to resort to using my martial skill to subdue him─which is when I realize he's holding a sword. I drop my sword and run for my life.\nThat's when you appear. You take down the masked man and return me my sword. I was so scared I dropped my sword.\nI would have been slain had not you come to my rescue. Thanks to you, I am now able to resume the negotiations.\nI would have been slain had not you come to my rescue. Thanks to you, I am now able to resume the negotiations.\nThis is a fine arrangement.

I will not keep you any longer.\nShould you ever wish to trade in Gridania, pray speak with my friend, the guildmaster."]

That's why I've asked that you procure the materials you require─steel balls of sufficient size and strength to pierce even the thickest of steel armor.\nThe balls are common enough, and even a miner should have no trouble finding them. What I require is a special sort of ore, one with a certain...perfume.\nThe Resistance has long used coal as its primary fuel, but even the poorest miners can find some amount of it in their quarrying grounds.\nCoal is fiendishly difficult to come by in large quantities, however, and even if it were, how would I procure the requisite quantity?\nI'm afraid I have no choice but to ask that you procure the coal in my stead. The only way I'd be able to make my weapons last is if they were forged from a solid foundation of good steel.\nI've already sent someone to the Hammers to inquire about the ore.
