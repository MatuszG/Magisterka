I shall inform the agavoides themselves and see that they are taken care of.\nIt is not difficult to find an agavoides horridus. Simply leave it be and I shall see that it is taken care of.

That would be a poor start to any endeavor.', '\nTui-Shirr:', '\nSir, I have found all the young agavoides I was able to find.\nI shall return to the Dawn Throne and inform the agavoides themselves.

I'm sure you must have some pressing matters to attend to, but if you could spare a moment, I would ask a favor of you.\nOn the beach far to the east of here, you will find a peculiar place called the “Bitter Snow.” It was here that my father first made his way, fleeing from the chaos that erupted when the Empire attacked.\nMy mother, meanwhile, made her way here after escaping the Garleans. I imagine her searching for my father, though I doubt she knows where he may have gone.\nI am forever in her debt, and I hope to one day repay the debt in some way.\nPlease, will you assist me in finding my father?\nIt would not do to keep him waiting.\nIf you should find him first, you may wish to convey the situation to him.

Dialogue: ['\nKokosamu:', "\nI'm pleased to see you've come─much obliged, in fact. I've just finished sweeping the floors, and I've been given charge of preparing the banquet hall.\nI've also made arrangements for the arrival of our guests. I've just finished tidying up the area, and I've been tasked with overseeing the provision of each course.\nBefore I can do so, however, I must needs finish crafting the main course. It's no small task, and I could use the help of a capable chef.\nIn order to ensure a menu of sufficient variety, I've scoured the market and spoken with several vendors. They range from simple to sublime─from mushroom soup to mushroom soup with a kick─but all are delicious.\nIf you're interested in sampling their wares, I invite you to a spot of testing at the market. I won't tell you how much it'll cost, of course...\nOh, and before you go, I've prepared a few appetizers that you may enjoy. I'll be along shortly.\nNow, let's get to work─assuming you've brought your Aethernet knife and your spoon, of course!\nI set about making my way through the aisles, pausing only to grab a cup of cold water when I come across a particularly enticing specimen
