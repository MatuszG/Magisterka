I fear for the safety of our troops, but I have no doubt that you will save them.", '\nDmitar:', "\nIt is good to see you again, Commander. When the time is ripe, I shall call upon you again.", '\nDmitar:', '\nI take it you have heard of the atrocities committed by the Empire in their crusade against the Resistance. I have no doubt that you will save them.', '\nDmitar:', '\nAh, so it seems that the Resistance is not to be underestimated. I am relieved to see that you have done all in your power to help them.\nTo be honest, I was not expecting you to come so soon. You have not only saved our men, but I have also heard great things of you. I have no doubt that you will have

I'll gather some of the wood's fallen leaves, which might be enough to get me started.\nYou're a familiar, aren't you?

Dialogue: ['\nMimiomio:', "\nWell met, adventurer. I've heard your name before─that's for certain. Aye, you're quite the fighter, aren't you? I've a job for you, if you're interested in it.\nMy men and I are in the midst of preparing a new batch of marzipan, but as you can see, we've had a bit of a problem.\nThe quality of the fruit we harvest has been lacking, and I fear it may even be too late to salvage the crop. If you could retrieve some of the seeds from the trees around here, I'm sure we'd be in your debt.", '\nMimiomio:', '\nPlease, you must help us. We've got a lot of work to do.', '\nMimiomio:', "\nYou've already helped us, have you? I'm sure you would do well to take a moment and thank the sylphs for their help.\nForgive me, I was lost in my thoughts. I should have known better than to come here, but I was on a mission, and I couldn't leave my men to starve to death.\nYou're a fine man, Forename─I know I would have been the same way had you not come along. I hope we can count on your aid in the future."]

Dialogue: ['\nSorocan:', "\nAye, this is it. I'm ready to go─if you're not, you shouldn't be.\nI've been in search of a new weapon, and the scimitars I've seen fit to give you would do nicely. You've seen to them, I take it, and I'm ready to do the same.\nTake a look around. You'll find plenty of scimitars here. I'll lend you a hand with some practice.\nBefore I can offer you any, however, I need you to slay a dragon for me.\nThe dragons are a problem for us, as they hunt the creatures that feed on the scimitars. I'd wager you know a thing or two about the beasts, but I wouldn't ask if you didn't.\nThere's a place to the northwest of here where they congregate. Take that dragon and slay it for me.\nBy the same token, don't leave the scimitars unattended. They might catch a chill, and I've never been cold worse.", '\nSorocan:', '\nBy the same token, don't leave the scimitars unattended.

That's a bold decision─but one that's made in good conscience.\nIt's the scimitars that keep the Garleans at bay. We don't have the resources to send troops to the front line to fight the dragons.\nAnd, as you've undoubtedly noticed, the Garleans are not exactly friendly to anyone who dares cross their path.\nIf we don't have scimitars to fall back on, we'll have to rely on the Doman units to do the fighting.\nI hope you'll keep your mouth shut about the rest of that, though. If you do decide to join the Doman forces, I've no doubt you'll get your teeth broken for the next few weeks or months.\nIf you've any questions about joining the Doman forces, I'm sure you can find them in my correspondence.\nThanks again for your help.
