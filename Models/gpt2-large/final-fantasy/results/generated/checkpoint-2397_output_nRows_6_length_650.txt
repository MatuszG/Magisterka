Dialogue: ['\nHien:', "So good to see you, Forename. It's good to see you.\nI've been thinking a while now, and it's time I told you about my adventures with the White Wolf.\nThe White Wolf was my first creation─and the first to be released into the world. It was a remarkable achievement, but I was also faced with a daunting task: how to make something truly unique, something that would satisfy the eyes of all who encounter it.\nBut I knew I couldn't do it alone. I needed help, and the only way I could find it was to take part in a contest designed by the esteemed master of alchemy, Father Jalzahn.\nI would meet with him in the deserts of Thanalan and present my creation to him. The only way I could do it was to take part in a contest designed by the esteemed master of alchemy, Father Jalzahn.\nBut I knew I couldn't do it alone. I needed help, and the only way I could find it was to take part in a contest designed by the esteemed master of alchemy, Father Jalzahn.\nMy first attempt at creating a new creation was a complete failure─and the first to be destroyed before even reaching its potential. I knew then that I had to find a way to surpass my previous work.\nThat is why I am so excited to be speaking with you, Forename. I hope my creation will please you as much as it pleased my father.\nI can scarcely wait to show you my newest masterpiece! When you see it for yourself, you will agree─it is truly something to behold.\nThere is a passage in the Holy Kojin's Doman treatise that describes a technique by which the eye reacts to a living being. I have chosen to employ this technique in my creation─to allow the eye to perceive aetherial energy flowing through my soul.\nThis means that when the creature you gaze upon becomes a part of you, the eye can no longer simply perceive aetherial energy flowing between your physical being and the creature─it must also perceive a bond between soul and soul.\nFor this reason, I wanted you to gaze upon my creation with your own eyes. If you can truly capture the essence of my creation, it will no longer simply be an ordinary gilgan─it will become something with a soul!\nIn order to do so, I need you to retrieve a gemstone of exceptional purity from the cave where I hid it.\nI would ask you to retrieve this gemstone from the cave in question. The cave is located in the northern reaches of Thanalan.\nPlease bring me the gemstone you find from the cave. When you have it, pray bring me my soul as well.\nIf all goes according to plan, I am sure that when you behold my creation, you will feel as if you have found your own soulmate.\nOh, and before I forget, if you would like to know more about my latest creation,

Dialogue: ['\nKomuxio:', "\nWelcome, honored guest. I am Komuxio, researcher and master of this new feline creation─a fusion of an amaro and a golden jackal.\nIt is my hope that this research may lead to a new breed of feline that is more intelligent and resilient than its ancestors, and that such a breed may perform the role of courier for the Order of the Twin Adder.\nIt would not do to send a single courier, of course, and so I have pooled our resources to create a more efficient system.\nThe first step in this process was to acquire the necessary raw materials for this creation─crystals of exceptional size and strength. We then added a single, highly efficient transmission node to this fusion, which serves as a sort of intermediary between the two feline entities.\nAnd here we are─the feline courier, complete with its own onboard memory.\nOf course, this is but the first step in creating a more efficient system. I shall need your help in testing and refining the node before it is officially activated.\nThe more efficient transmission node, as you might expect, is comprised of a pair of crystallized cores. These cores contain various kinds of memories, and will be used to activate the successor node.\nWith the cores in place, the messenger will be able to communicate with any other feline entities that share a similar form, such as an amaro or a golden jackal. The more intelligent of these creatures may even be able to perform tasks for the less intelligent.\nBut enough of my rambling. You are doubtless wondering why the creation of this fusion node is of such great importance.\nFor one thing, it is a direct replacement for the loss of a vital part of the Amaro's original form. In fact, its creation was a direct response to the catastrophic loss of that limb.\nTo ensure that such a creature is sent out into the world as a messenger, we have designed it to possess the following traits: a keen sense of smell; a resilient body; and, most importantly, a rich repertoire of innate behavioral traits.\nAs a result of these traits, it is expected that it will be the most effective courier for the Order of the Twin Adder─a role that requires an extremely skilled and resourceful individual.\nI am pleased to say that, in cooperation with the Scions, I have been able to find a suitable candidate.\nYou see, the messenger is equipped with two transmitters, one of which is equipped with a powerful-yet-simple sense of smell. The other is equipped with a more advanced sense of smell, which allows it to perceive a far more diverse range of odors.\nWith these additional senses, it should be possible to create a more versatile and efficient courier. I would like you to assist me in testing the candidate, and in refining the node as a whole.\nThe messenger is scheduled to arrive in Vesper Bay quite soon, so I would ask that you begin preparations for its arrival by retrieving the

Falkbryda was born into a noble family, but he had become destitute of late and was desperate to get his belongings out to the people.\nHe had not the time to spare to go through the city, and so he made his way to Lost Hope by boat. He was carrying a large crate, and I believe the boy inside was his.\nWhen the merchant boat came to a stop, the boy slipped out and hid until the merchant had safely loaded the crate onto the next boat. The next he knew, he was in the hands of the bandits!\nI was able to track the bandits down and track them down, and we tracked them all the way to Lost Hope. I suspect the boy gave the bandits my name, and I suspect the bandits gave him my name!\nI suspect the bandits were trying to kill the boy, but that he somehow managed to elude them for so long.
