Dialogue: ['\nBaderon:', "\nGood morrow, sinner. I've got a favor to ask of you.\nI trust you've heard the rumors, yes? Of late, the Brugaire Consortium has been laying low some of the Consortium's more unsavory characters.\nSome of them, I'm told, even took part in the Calamity. Needless to say, those rumors bear a lot of weight.\nAnd because these men are known to use their positions to their advantage, any cooperation they might have with the authorities is suspect.\nI mean to put an end to all that. If you're willing, I'd be most obliged if you could pick up a man by the name of “Abaka” in Bulwark Hall, just below the Drowning Wench. He's a tough bastard, but if you can flush him out, I guarantee you'll have his information.", '\nAbaka:', "\nWho are you and what do you want?\nI'm a lowly sellsword, you see, but I've a wife and three children. A life of quiet desperation, to be precise. I can barely speak the name of my children's favorite bandit, let alone their criminal associates.\nYou're after my information, you say? What's this? A ledger of the kinds we've been seeing? It's only a matter of time before these men are identified.\nI was about to close up shop and take a well-earned rest, but a friend told me I'm not to be taken lightly. He said I might be able to count on a generous tip.\nIf you're up to the task, why not take yourself to Bulwark Hall and see what Abaka has to say?", '\nBaderon:', "\nWelcome back. I trust the information you obtained was helpful?\nThen there's your reward. I don't know what you would've gotten from going to Bulwark Hall, but at least you didn't buy anything Abaka didn't mention.\nAnd that's all you can say? Not a single word of credit, credit, credit, eh? You had to go and get that from him, I suppose."]

This would be an unfortunate outcome of the negotiations, but it is not out of the question.\nI am told that the Ixal have established a base of operations in the northern reaches. Given what you have told me, I should think it more than likely that their base of operations is in the region of Lake Tusi Mek'ta.', '\nE-Sumi-Yan:', 'Ah, but how did you arrive at this conclusion?\nI am pleased to say that I am now able to share with you the complete history of the Camp of the High Crucible.\nFrom the moment the Ixal first laid eyes on the settlement, their leaders have been plotting their next move.\nThey knew we were not to be trusted, but they went ahead and decided to ally with us. They even went so far as to request reinforcements from the other nations.\nYet even with the aid of the allies, it was not enough to defeat the Ixal. After conferring with the leaders of other nations, we came to a conclusion: we must needs conquer the area of Lake Tusi Mek'ta.\nAnd so we did. In the aftermath of the battle for Castellum Velodyna, we laid out a defensive line along the Velodyna River. \nThe Ixal, on the other hand, had no interest in establishing a base of operations in the northern reaches. They wanted only to seize territory in southern Thanalan.\nBut the Magna Glacies were not to be ignored. Indeed, it was the Magna Glacies that first invited the Ixal to engage our forces.\nThe Magna Glacies were not to be left to be defeated, but rather, won the battle.\nSo the question is not what will the Ixal do, but rather, how will we best respond to them?\nI have been asked to lead a force comprised of adventurers and mercenaries who wish to claim back their homeland. The decision is not mine to make, but rather yours to take.\nAdventurers, mercenaries, and citizens of Thanalan all have a common interest in seeing this land reclaimed.

It's only fitting that a performer of your caliber would return to me─and beg for my aid in arming and training him!\nNow, here's the rub: even the most accomplished performer cannot perform without his instrument.\nIf you can bring me a single hornet bone from the dunes south of here, I will see that it is safely and properly mounted on your person.\nIf it isn't here, it's been lying around somewhere. Oh, and you'll want to make sure no pests are hiding inside. I'll be watching from here.\n", '\nLad Kenn:', 'Well? Did you bring me a single hornet bone?\nAh, yes, this is it! Now, while I securely mount the bird, I want you to use this bone to adjust the weight of the plectrum. Kenn Musicians use these adjustments to control the pitch of their instruments.\nEasy as dropping a feather into a bucket, Kenn Musicians can instantly adjust their instruments to match their playing style. Kenn Musicians love their instruments so much that they often purchase more than one.\nBut of course, that is not to say they don't need their instruments. They need them to perform.\nAs your guildmaster, it is your responsibility to see them safely back to me. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have preparations to make!']

We made our share of drudgery─some say I made more of it than them─but the end was in sight.\nWhen the Admiral ordered the blockade of the bakufu forces at the Ruby Sea, our entire crew was ordered to sail north to rendezvous with the Red Swallows on the cape. That was the last I saw of my brothers, and the last I will see of them, I assure you.\nAfter the disaster at Titania, the Red Swallows turned their focus to the Sahagin Sea, and we were all but forgotten. We had no choice but to go where the fish was, which was where you come in.\nThe cap'n of the Maelstrom, Lord Drillemont, was the first to offer me the chance to join the Red Swallows. I had heard tales of the pirates who once manned the nearby Pharos Sirius, but I had no inkling the Admiral would be relying on me to rescue him from certain ruin.\nBut what I found instead was a crew of men who were more than a match for the Sahagin. They had come ashore in search of supplies, and I was to be their equal, not their enemy.\nThat, my friend, is where you come in. You are a man of the sea, and a man of the Admiral's household.

Title: A Brave Resolution
Dialogue: ['\nAlphinaud:', "It would seem all is not yet lost.\nYet to secure a foothold in the Fringes, we must needs bend the knee to the powers that be.\nWe have no choice but to submit to the Empire's authority, to bend the knee before the imperials and submit our lives to the Empire's will.\nIn so doing, we risk losing what little we have─the fewest number of soldiers in history to surrender their lives in battle.\nYet we must not surrender our freedom to a tyrant.\nI speak not of the man who would be Emperor, for the time being. I speak only of a figurehead who represents the will of the people, the people of Ul'dah.\nWill Ul'dah be free once more? Will the people of Ul'dah be free once more? That is the question, and I dare not think on it until I find the answer.\nI would gauge the strength of the Resistance by the number of soldiers who lay down their arms. If the people of Ul'dah are truly ready to bend the knee, then I would see it with my own eyes.\nBut how? How will we go about gathering our forces? How will we wage war? These are matters that we cannot shirk our duty to the nation.\nI have thought of all. Yet even with so many problems facing us, I cannot imagine we can succeed on our own.\nThe Resistance is a bulwark against the Empire. It is our duty to defend it, and if we are to be defeated, we must first be victorious.\nAnd I cannot in good conscience permit the Resistance to be weakened by a single soldier's surrender.\nI would have you escort my forces to the Senaculum Imperialis.\nIf the people of Ul'dah are truly willing to bend the knee, then I would see them with my own eyes. That is all I ask, and I trust you will do your part."]
