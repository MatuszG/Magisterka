All of them have been quite nicely captured, I must say.\nThe slugs are especially troublesome, as they burrow into the snow and become difficult to remove without explosives. You might need to use explosives to soften the snow a bit before slipping this in.\nThe hawks are hard to pin down, as they burrow into the snow and then slither away to their burrow holes. This leaves me with no choice but to shoot them from a distance.\nI'd be ever more grateful if you could take this for your troubles. I'll be watching over the animals in the meantime."]
