In return for the crystal you have brought me, I wish to entrust to you the secrets of a new type of explosive.\nAlas, I am unable to provide you with the necessary quantity of the explosive you seek. As such, I would have you procure the necessary quantity of gunk from the animals of the Velodyna River.\nA simple task, you might think.

Did you procure the necessary quantity of gunk?', '\nHamon:', '\nAh, yes, this is more than enough. Now all that is left is to tempt fate and choose the method of delivery.\nI suppose I should tell you the details of the method I chose... It goes like this: \nThe explosive you have brought me is made of a mix of plant and animal matter. The animals are killed in the usual way, and the mix is placed in sacks which are then placed outside the village.\nAfter a time, the lambs will become so accustomed to the smell of the food that they will not even notice the smell of the carcasses.\nI am confident that, should the explosive be properly combined, it will be capable of destroying even the most heavily guarded of structures.\nOf course, this assumes that the explosive is also capable of penetrating the earth. While I am confident that the information I have provided you is correct, I am not certain. It is my hope that you will ask Master Arvide to have the explosive tested in the Velodyna River. \nThe explosive you have brought me is made of a mix of plant and animal matter.

It was said that as the Azure Dragoon marched through the streets of Ishgard, his harp would sound the note of victory.\nNeedless to say, that never stopped me from pursuing my dream of being a musician. While I am not one to skulk about in search of a place to make my fortune, I have heard tell that the Azure Dragoon's home is a place of great significance.

But then I heard it for myself, at the feet of the Azure Dragoon himself.\nEver since that day, I have been filled with the knowledge of how the music of song can inspire even the staunchest of souls. I have dedicated my life to pursuing that knowledge, and am thrilled to be able to share it with you.\nWhen the time is ripe, I will be conducting a competition to select the greatest performer from among our esteemed guests. Though I am sure that you will be among the first to submit your rendition of the harp, I would be most honored if you were to play it at your own game.\nThere is still much that I need learn about the Exarchal Family's land and the Exarchal Banquet, but I look forward to doing so.\nAh, yes─I should mention that the harp you have just received is of exceptional quality. I will take it from here.\nThank you for your honor at the Exarchal Banquet. I am honored to have been able to present you with this gift. I hope that it serves you well in your pursuit of greatness!']

We used to wrap our prayers around this, and now we simply leave it at the end of our spears. This is a small token of our gratitude to the gods for providing us with the sustenance we need.\nThank you for your help. Please take this as a token of our appreciation.']

And as they battle, they find themselves drawn ever closer to one another, ever losing themselves in the fever of battle.\nTheir final match is to take place in a desolate land far, far away. But there is something about this place─something that brings them together, that brings them even as they fight.\nSo I set about researching a means to transport themselves and their match to a place they could never have dreamed of having met in the first place. I discovered an old tome, “A Blissful Arrival”─which, by the grace of the gods, is now mine!\nNow, while I could not hope to match the verisimilitude of the tome, I thought I might be able to tell a story that was at least as epic as the tome. And with the help of my friend, I was able to weave together two stories of the utmost import, A Blissful Arrival: The Hero and the Seedseer.\nI think you will enjoy both of these tales, Forename. And, of course, I hope you will find the means to transport yourself and your match to a place they could never have dreamed of having met in the first place.\nNow, I know that this will seem like a trifling matter to some, but as an adventurer of your caliber, you cannot help but want to see the world. And when you have the opportunity to travel, you are always tempted to go where there is work to be done.\nSo please, do not hesitate to let me know when you are ready to depart. And may I say, I will be waiting for you here─in the meantime, I've prepared this sampler of wine from my personal stock. Enjoy!"]
