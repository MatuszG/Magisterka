To make matters worse, he could scarce even begin to imagine how such an extraordinary being would evolve.\nIn the end, he simply froze it, and it has been asleep ever since.\nBut thanks to you, the Aery is no longer a frozen husk, and its creator has an opportunity to further develop the concept in new and novel ways.\nHe can do so by employing a variety of artificial entities, each of which is a distinct individual with its own thoughts, feelings, and memories.\nFor this, he needs but ask. Take this crystal, and place it within the Aery─as you would do with any other piece of equipment.\nI pray that the Aery awakes, and that, in its bright and new consciousness, it remembers the day you first placed it within it.
