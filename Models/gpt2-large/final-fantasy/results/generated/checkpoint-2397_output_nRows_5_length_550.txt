It's no wonder that so many of our client's come to settle here.\nThe cityscape is so varied, the architecture so distinctive, and the people so fascinating─it's no wonder that so many choose to call this the home of their lives.\nAnd that's why I'm so pleased to see that our newest residents have chosen to stay within these walls─they'll surely make the city a home to them for life!\nSo what do you say? Are they a good match for us, friend?\n...Hah! Well, I can hardly blame you for choosing an unfamiliar city. It's a far cry from the bustling streets of Ul'dah or Ul'dah's neighbor to the north, but I daresay that it'll be worth your while.\nLimsa Lominsa isn't a city for everyone, and that's certainly not my intent. I only hope that my new residents will respect and honor our traditions and customs, and that they'll live long and prosper in our great city!"]

Title: A Bargain Struck
Dialogue: ['\nGildon:', "Have you heard of the bargain the two sides struck?\nAye, the details are rather more nebulous than you might think. The gist is this: the Garleans offered up an abundance of rare minerals in exchange for the use of magitek weaponry.\nNow, I'm not entirely certain of the details, but it sounds like the terms were rather generous─to the point that some believe the Garleans profited from the deal.\nBut if true, the minerals must have been extremely valuable─so valuable that the Garleans felt they had little recourse but to use them.\nAnd in exchange, the Empire has agreed to supply the Gnath with magitek weaponry to supplement their dwindling supplies of conventional weaponry.\nAs such, the deal has left the Gnath with no choice but to band together and form a single unified force.\nIt would not surprise me in the least to learn that the Gnath were working in collusion, given the degree of their mutual support.\nBut what would be the point of coming together if we did not benefit from their cooperation? What would be the point of pursuing our shared goals if we only ended up with half the gains?\nWhich brings us to the question: how did the Gnath choose to acquire the weapons?\nIt's all but certain that the weapons were acquired by the Gnath in part through a deal with the Empire.\nI daresay that the Gnath have amassed considerable quantities of magitek weaponry over the course of their existence. It may be a coincidence, but I can think of no other way that the weapons could have come to be in the hands of the Gnath.\nIt is of utmost importance that we ascertain the full extent of the deal. While we continue to gather information, I would ask that you speak with the Gnath themselves.\nI would also ask that you speak with the Gnath known as Amalj'aa. They may have information that could help us piece together the full extent of the agreement.", '\nAmalj'aa:', "Greetings, hunter. I am Amalj'aa, an officer of the Amalj'aa. As you may have heard, we were charged with recovering the Gnath weapons.\nI would ask you a single question, but it would not do to keep the matter here.

Title: A Bold Decision
Dialogue: ['\nUrianger:', '\n<sigh> I know not what I have done, but surely I did not send my son to his death.\nBut perhaps I am not so foolish as to send him to his death─perhaps Urianger has the right of it.\nI am no good at making decisions─I am not even good at asking questions. And that is why I must ask you to make a decision for me.\nYou see, I am in the process of organizing a new unit of scouts for the Order of the Twin Adder. We have just recently finished posting new recruits, and I would like you to help me by helping to select them.\nPlease speak with my comrades in Camp Tranquil─they will tell you more. Come meet me in the Brume when you are done.', '\nUrianger:', '\nPlease speak with my comrades in Camp Tranquil─they will tell you more.

I hope you did not suffer any undue loss in the selection process.', '\nUrianger:', '\nThank you, Forename. I am pleased to say that Urianger and his men have made an excellent start to patrolling the area near the North Shroud.\nAs you can imagine, I am eager to hear your thoughts on the new scouts.

I must say, I'm a little disappointed in myself for not taking better care to select them.\nIt is my responsibility as commander to make sure our new soldiers are fit to serve in the field. And I owe it to them to ensure that they are well prepared for the battles to come.\nBut I am also pleased to say that they have made an excellent start to patrolling the area near the North Shroud.\nI can only imagine what Urianger and his men have done to prepare themselves for the battles to come.\nThey have

Title: A Bold Decision
Dialogue: ['\nAlphinaud:', '\nIf we are to avert disaster, then we must act now.\nI am relieved to see the White Rams are on our side.\nIndeed, our victory is already a foregone conclusion. But that is not to say it is all roses.\nThere was yet another attempt to seize the stronghold, this time led by a band of Eorzean mercenaries.\nTheir leader, a man called Wedge, was slain in the initial assault. However, he managed to flee to the south, making it unlikely he would return to the main camp in time to help us.\nWith him gone, however, there is no one else to turn to for aid. I fear that without reinforcements, we will be forced to make a difficult decision─to fight this battle to the last, or turn to the Garleans.\nI must needs ask that you seek out Wedge in his former encampment. If you succeed in convincing him to join our cause, he may be of assistance to you in the future.', '\nWedge:', "\nWelcome back. Forename─I've heard all about you and your exploits.\nI'm sure you've heard whispers of our victory already. It's good to know the people are beginning to unite.\nIt's my hope that the Garleans will have no choice but to respond in kind.\nIf they do, I fear we shall have little time to rest on our laurels.\nFor now, we must turn to the task at hand: capturing the remaining leaders of the Garlean forces.\nMy commanding officer has instructed me to give you this assignment. I ask you only this: do not disappoint me.\nYou are to head out in the direction of the southern encampment and confront any Garlean soldiers you find.", '\nWedge:', '\nIf the Garleans should attack again, I pray we have you to save us.', '\nWedge:', '\nYou have spared me much pain, but not my life. Come, let us make for the southern encampment.', '\nWedge:', '\nYou are returned, and I am pleased to say I have not been wounded.\nWe have been forced to turn to the task at hand. If we are to avert disaster, then we must act now.\nI must needs ask that you seek out Wedge in his former encampment.
