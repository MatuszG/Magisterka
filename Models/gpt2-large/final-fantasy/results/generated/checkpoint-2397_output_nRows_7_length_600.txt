Dialogue: ['\nFelicitous Furball:', "I'm told you're keen on learning more about our creations, and I'm right! It's a fine feeling, I should think, to be able to work alongside such accomplished individuals!\nAs it happens, you're already quite accomplished─which is more than I can say about some other refugees I've met. You see, as part of our work to aid the restoration of Saint Mocianne's Arboretum, we've been in contact with a number of researchers who are working on new instruments.\nI can tell you from personal experience that they're some of the most talented individuals I've ever met, and I'm certain that having the chance to work with them would go a long way to improving my own instrument!\nBut I'm sure you're already aware of this, so I'll just reiterate: if you're interested in learning more, you're welcome to visit the arboretum and speak with any of our researchers.\nIf I may interject, I'm afraid I must ask that you refrain from approaching any of our researchers with pitchforks or torches in hand. While we understand that our work may be of benefit to them, approaching them with those weapons in hand may cause them to take offense. In any case, I hope you'll consider speaking with them in person before you try to start a fight.", '\nPitiless Furball:', "Ah, you're back! What did you learn of our latest creations?\nOho, I see. Well, I think I've finally got something that can rival the might of our most revered ancestors!\nBut before I show you this, I'd best explain what this is all about.\nWhen the Seventh Sage summoned Bahamut's might, he did so with the intent of destroying all creation─including us. Our creation, however, is far more than mere fodder for his fury. It is a means of transcending his boundless rage and saving creation from its despair.\nWith this, we seek to do just that, and to that end we've dubbed our creation “a blessing instrument.” It is a gift from the heavens that brings blessing to all who use it, and its power grows as we continue using it.\nIt is a tool that we feel is beyond our reach, but with the help of generous souls like you, we're confident we can reach out and touch that which we cannot.\nI can tell you all about our new creations, but I'd rather you learned of them for yourself. If you'd like to know more, you're welcome to visit the arboretum and speak with any of our researchers.\nIf I may interject, I'm afraid I must ask that you refrain from approaching any of our researchers with pitchforks or

Its base is covered in a golden hue, and the tip is adorned with a set of jade scales.\nIts name is “the golden horn of Ok' Zundu.” What's more, its creator intended it to serve as the centerpiece of a new temple dedicated to the worship of Ok' Zundu.\nThe temple is to be built atop the ruins of an ancient temple, that is said to have been dedicated to the worship of an ancient goddess.\nLegend has it that, when the great serpent awoken, it lashed out with its fiery horns, devouring the land in its wake. It was during this time that the great temple was abandoned and all that was left behind was a scattering of rubble.\nIn order to save what was left of it, the people of the region constructed a wooden stonework atop the ruins. These stoneworks were known as “the golden horn of Ok' Zundu.”\nIt was from these stoneworks that the Iliud was able to procure the golden horn.\nBut the people of Ok' Zundu were not content to abandon their temple. They believed that the ruins could be used to rebuild it─and that, with the aid of the great wyrm, they would accomplish this task.\nAnd so it was that, with the aid of the great wyrm, the people of Ok' Zundu constructed the Azys Lla solar.\nYes, it is true that the people of Ok' Zundu built their temple atop the ruins of an ancient temple.

We believe that the time has come for us to once again unite under the banner of the Twin Adder, and that the time has come for the Grand Companies to unite under the auspices of the Eorzean Alliance.\nThe Holy See further decrees that the Eorzean Alliance shall work together with other Eorzean nations to ensure that the threat of war does not recede.\nWe must make preparations for a potential assault on Castellum Velodyna, and that we shall continue to coordinate our efforts with the Resistance.\nI am pleased to inform you that the Holy See has authorized the production of a new type of magitek armor─the magitek field armor.\nThis armor is capable of penetrating magitek field, allowing our troops to penetrate enemy defenses with impunity.\nField armor is to be used in conjunction with magitek magitek, allowing our troops to overwhelm enemy forces and seize the initiative.\nMagitek field armor is to be employed in conjunction with magitek magitek, allowing our troops to overwhelm enemy forces and seize the initiative.\nI am pleased to inform you that the Holy See has authorized the production of a new type of magitek armor─the magitek field armor.\nField armor is to be used in conjunction with magitek magitek,
