I take it you've heard the tales, but the man who would become your greatest rival never set foot in the Pandæmonium.\nInstead, he spent his formative years in the Shadow of the Storm─a place which, in the parlance of our people, is known as the Pandæmonium.\nI say “pandæmonium” because, unlike our homelands, the Shadow of the Storm did not host a single native panda.\nThe wild fowl, it seems, were all but extinct in the Central Circuit.\nBut thanks to the efforts of a handful of dedicated researchers, we have learned a great deal about the creatures in their natural habitat. And thanks to our captive specimens, we have been able to cross-pollinate varieties that would otherwise be unable to cross the pond.\nThat is why, in the interests of both science and sport, the Pandæmonium has been established as the premier venue for panda breeding.\nBut even as we strive to fill the void left by the bumbling wits of Azim, it seems we are in danger of treading on equally unwaveringly deadly poison.\nFortunately, the antidote is readily found and equally easy to procure.\nBut I fear that in spite of our best efforts, the task may prove more difficult than we anticipated.\nAs ever, your talents are more valuable to us than any trophy you can hunt. We require but one more ingredient to complete our brew─crystals of exceptional quality.\nI would have you and your companions travel to the East Circuit in search of such crystals. I will personally ensure that you and your behemoth of a weapon find them.\nOnce you have located the crystals, deliver them to Papawazu.

For example, there may be occasions when cross-pollinating a species with a different parent is required.\nBut even if such circumstances should arise, such a method would not be employed here.\nA panda is not meant to hunt a single prey. It is meant to prey on the fauna and flora of a place, and only in so doing will it grow strong enough to take its place in the natural order.\nThus, for all intents and purposes, a panda is a tool. A tool which will be used to kill and eat other tool.\nIt would not be fair to pit tool against tool, would it? Should the stronger of the two be destroyed, the panda will take its place. It would be just as fair if the stronger of the two were created from scratch.\nAnd so it is that I ask you this, Forename: do not hesitate to use your newfound powers in pursuit of your goals.\nWhen next you face a panda in the wilds, make sure you bring it back to me. I will see to the procuring of the antidote."]
