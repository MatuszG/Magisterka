But one thing's for certain─it's ours now!\nNow that it's here, we can get to work. Here, take this pot. It's a gift from our patron, and it's all yours to take.\nNow, you may not be aware of this, but the residents of the Twelveswood use a variety of herbs and spices to prepare their food.\nSome of these, such as cardamom and coriander, are native to the Twelveswood, and we've been asked to prepare a variety for you─both for your personal use and as a gift for you and yours.\nNow, before you go and take any of this away, you may want to consult a practitioner of herbs and spices.\nThe man who best knows the local flora and fauna in a given area is the security guard, so you'll want to ask him first.\nAnd if you ever want for more, you can always visit the shop on the opposite side of the station.

Though we may have lost her at the battle with the Dragons, we do not forget her.\nAlthough we may now be a nation of gods, as Lady Kugane was, she was not one to deny us the opportunity to learn the ways of our faith.
