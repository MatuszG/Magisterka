Title: A Beeautiful Plan
Dialogue: ['\nPapawazu:', '\nSo it is the moment we have been waiting for, Forename!\nWe are pleased to inform you that the final phase of the plan has finally come to fruition!\nThe plan is to use a new type of plant to kill off the bees that pollinate the flowers.\nThe plant is the same one that was used to destroy the creatures that terrorize our crops.\nTo accomplish this, we need to collect and store a large quantity of pollen. This is where you come in!\nTo begin with, we will need to take care of the bees, and then we will harvest their pollen.\nThe beekeeper that you have encountered should be able to provide you with a large quantity of the pollen.\nAs the plan progresses, we shall need to expand our harvest to include other types of flowers.\nWe may even want to add a few more flowers to the list of options.\nOnce the plan is complete, we will have the power to bring this plant to life.\nPlease, take care of the bees!', '\nPop:', '\nA buzzing bee comes!', '\nPop:', '\nA buzzing bee comes!', '\nPop:', '\nA buzzing bee comes!', '\nPop:', '\nA buzzing bee comes!', '\nPapawazu:', "\nIt has been quite some time since we have had an opportunity to see the flowers in their natural state.\nOur thanks to you, Forename!\nYou have proven yourself a capable and resourceful individual, but I must ask that you be more mindful of your surroundings.\nI will be on my way back to Ul'dah to join my fellow researchers in their research. I will take care of the bees and then return to you in the meantime.\nWe are honored to have you at our side! Take care of the bees and come back here when you are ready for more."]
