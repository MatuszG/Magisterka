There's a rather long and somewhat technical explanation in the “Diabolical Parts” section of the staff file. Suffice it to say, you won't find it there.\nInstead, what you need to know is that this particular instrument belongs to a species of plant that bears a striking resemblance to a dreamcatcher.\nThese curious plants produce flowers that resemble the creatures in some way, but they don't have the intelligence to understand it.\nWhile some may see in a simple green or white flower a reflection of the creature that once belonged to a different species, for others, the flowers may appear anything but.\nAs such, some researchers have gone so far as to imbue the flowers with magical properties to better understand their phenomenon.\nThough we cannot be certain what effect the flowers will have on the creatures that once belonged to another species, one thing is certain─we cannot allow the creation of these flowers to proceed.\nAs such, I was hoping you might help

Dialogue: ['\nTataru:', '\nYou there! I need you to do something for us.\nLately, we have faced a sudden surge of beasts in the Central Shroud.\nIt started with a single high-ranking imperial soldier, but it has now spread to include a whole squad of our finest. It is a disaster.\nWe cannot survive without their support. If you were to bring three of their ranks down, it would be a tremendous help.\nPlease, go to Blind Iron Mines─one of our key outposts in the Central Shroud. Three of our best should be able to help us there.', '\nTataru:', '\nPlease, go to Blind Iron Mines and save three of our best.

You have saved our lives.\nI thought that I should give you something to remember your visit to the mines. It is a small token of our gratitude, but you will surely want it.']

Dialogue: ['\nVorsaile:', "\nAh, you've returned. What news do you have of our prisoner?\nOur man was captured while transporting fertilizer to a nearby field. He has yet to be interrogated, but it would seem he is not the hardened criminal many believed him to be.\nInstead, he is an enterprising young lad who helped his fellow prisoners escape. He knows nothing of the plot, but has decided to assist us in our investigation.
