Far from it.\nWhat one requires is an understanding of the means by which their art may be enhanced.\nIf one wishes to master the art of alchemy, then they must become acquainted with the methods employed by the most renowned alchemists of the past.\nNo doubt the most famous of these was Alphinaud, second only to Master Thubyrgeim.\nAlphinaud was born into a noble family. His father was Lord of the Scions of the Seventh Dawn. When Alphinaud was seven years old, the Dravanians invaded. His family was forced to flee.\nAfter fleeing to Ul'dah where his father awaited, Alphinaud began his studies of alchemy at the hands of Master Thubyrgeim.\nWhen the artificial sun first burned its first candle, the elixir of life was discovered. Alphinaud was among the first to isolate and synthesize this substance.\nHe was subsequently named captain of the Dravanian Raiders and assigned to the Sultansworn elite.\nAfter the fall of the Ultima Weapon, however, his position was taken by that of an assistant to Mistress Matoya.\nUpon learning of the artificial sun's destruction, he swore himself to the Sultansworn and its new order.\nAlphinaud devoted his life to the refinement of alchemy, creating and refining it at an alarming rate. At one point he even began mixing his own blood with the substance to create a serum that could be administered to the troops.\nIt was not long into this process that he discovered the means by which his art might be enhanced.\nHe refined the process further, eventually creating a serum that could grant the user a myriad of magical powers.\nHe administered this to his troops, who were thrilled to receive it. Though his intentions were good, his experiment was not without unintended consequences.\nAlisaie, the student he chose to train with, was thrilled as well.

The finest wool is used to make the uniforms of the Buduga, and you're no doubt welcome to wear one of your own to show your devotion.\nOh, and be sure to pay your respects to Chipper, the master of the Tomra guard.
