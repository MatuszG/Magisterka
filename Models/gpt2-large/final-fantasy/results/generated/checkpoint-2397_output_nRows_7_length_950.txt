Inside, they receive only the most nutrient-dense and most toxic substances.\nHowever, this isn't the end of their suffering. To make sure they don't escape, the entire colony is watched over by a pair of raptors.\nIf anything should happen to those raptors, the entire colony would be wiped out! Oh, I can't wait to see their faces when the flowers finally open their wings and fly away into the sunset...\nOh! I've already given you the pungent, but you still need to remove the poison pungent!\nMogok's been at work on these beauties ever since they were hatched, and I'm proud to say that they're now ready to bloom!\nYou're a lifesaver, friend!
