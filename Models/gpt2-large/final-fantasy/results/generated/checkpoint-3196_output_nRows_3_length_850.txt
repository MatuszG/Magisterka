Dialogue: ['\nDadanen:', '\nSo, you are keen on my proposition?\nVery well. I shall give you a fitting payment to entice you to part with your service.\nIn exchange for your services, I shall have you locate a suitable location for mining ores.\nI realize this may seem like a rather heavy burden at first, but bear with me.\nI shall explain the situation in greater detail once we begin. Now, off you go, and happy hunting!', '\nPop:', '\nYou sense a hostile presence!', '\nDadanen:', '\nPlease, allow me to explain. You see, in order to locate suitable ores, we miners must often brave dangerous territory.\nWhile it may not be pleasant, it is essential we find the necessary resources to our operations.\nUnfortunately, there are many dangerous creatures in our world that are not so easy to hunt.\nAs such, a great many of us choose to entrust our search to professional trappers such as yourself.\nWhile this may seem like a trivial matter, it has a tremendous impact on our economy. For every ton of ore processed, there are countless hours of unpaid work lost to unscrupulous trappers.\nYou, however, have the experience and the grit that I require. I believe you may succeed where I have failed.\nTherefore, I ask that you seek out and slay the creatures that threaten our miners in our region. This should afford you an ample opportunity to hone your skills.\nI do not mean to suggest that you will be faced with overwhelming odds, however. There is always a way─after all, you were not born with these skills.\nFor instance, when I was first hired, I was told to expect an onslaught of creatures. Yet I fought through it and made it back in one piece.\nSuch was the power of my conviction, and such was the strength of my spirit. I was hired precisely for my experience, and here is the reward for my efforts.\nPlease accept this as a token of my gratitude. And with that, farewell, and happy hunting!']
