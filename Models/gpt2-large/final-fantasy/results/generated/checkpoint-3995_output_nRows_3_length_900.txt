It's about time you came along.\nI've been thinking, and I've concluded that a piece of music may be of great use to you. It may even be of interest to you, I suppose, given your background.\nI will send word of all that has happened to my dear friend, you see. Perhaps you'll consider joining him on his journey as well.\nPray tell him that I said farewell, as well. He has much to learn, but I imagine he'll enjoy the music I made for him."]

Dialogue: ['\nRukusafarusa:', "\nAh, you've come at the perfect time. I've a task that can only be carried out by one with the divine grace of Halone, you see.\nYou see, the Domans living in the ruins beneath Il Mheg have commissioned an instrument of the sort you see before you. It was no easy task to procure one of a quality that meets their high standards, but I've managed to do so.\nI would be grateful if you could deliver it to the Domans in my stead.\nI realize it is a long journey back to the surface, but I promise that it will be worth your while.", '\nRukusafarusa:', '\nThe Domans in my stead will be pleased as peas with this gift. And you will be pleased to know that the Domans have entrusted the crafting of this instrument to none but the most gifted of blacksmiths.', '\nRukusafarusa:', "\nAs you can see, this is a fine-quality instrument. It will grace any blacksmith's shop with its rich, warm tone.\nIt is, of course, a property of the Domans themselves that this particular piece was crafted with such loving detail. The wood is of the highest quality, and all the joints are perfectly joined.\nYou would never be able to hear the music of a udgan if not for this instrument. The Domans have done a marvelous job of making this one, and I can recommend it to you without reserve.\nYou will, of course, be charged for your instrument. But before you go, I ask that you consider making a gift of it to one of your acquaintances in Limsa Lominsa.\nI realize it is a long journey back to the surface, but I promise that it will be worth your while."]

Dialogue: ['\nSeverian:', '\nI am glad to see you, Forename. I am ever glad to see a capable and industrious man like yourself working to the best of your abilities.\nAs you have no doubt heard, the mainstay of our guild's operations is the ever-so-useful “scab” wood. The material is harvested and processed at the Mog Squad's Rosehouse, and is sent to all of our branches with no less a fervor than a storm of lightning.\nNot all of the staff are content to dispense with the precious gift of music, of course─some crave greater challenges. I am pleased to see you have found a new calling in life.\nIn fact, I dare say you are already ahead of your time, Forename. If you would be so kind as to join me in the practice area, there is something I would ask of you.\nI would have you demonstrate to me the range of an aetherial hummer. This device is of the highest quality─crystals of such purity that I am almost certain to hear nothing but pure, untainted sound. I should not imagine that the task is any more taxing than you already have.\nBut before that, I would have you demonstrate to me the ability of “scab” wood. Practice this technique to the best of your ability, and I am sure you will find that your performance will improve.\nI realize what a burden this may place on you, but I ask that you make it worth your while. Pray practice to the best of your ability, and I am sure you will find that your performance will improve.', '\nSeverian:', '\nWelcome back, Forename. I take it you have been refining your technique at the Mog Squad Rosehouse.\nNow, while I am not certain how well this will translate to the practical world, I daresay it is equivalent to practicing your melodic lines over and over again! Hah hah hah!\nAye, that is precisely what we do─we hone our skills to new heights, ever seeking new challenges to challenge our minds and bodies.\nTo complete one's training, one must first be able to cope with the seemingly endless array of sounds that comprise aural reality. And by the time one has reached that state, one may well find that “scab” music has become as secondary to other interests and talents.\nTo that end, I present you with this hunting log. Within you will find the names of various beasts, both familiar and otherwise, which you are asked to hunt.\nThe notion that music is a tool of the mind is as old as time itself, but the arts have certainly changed in recent years.\nIn the old days, we taught our young ones the value of music and the importance of melody. As they grew, so too did we seek out new challenges, and so too did they grow in skill.\nToday, however, they seem to lack the sense of urgency and urgency of their musical counterparts. I daresay that their focus has grown as thin as a thread in the mists... <sigh> I fear that without a true passion, they will fail to realize their potential.\nBut I am not so naive as to think that all will be forgiven in due time. Indeed, the failure to seize the opportunities presented to us may well prove our greatest source of regret, for our young ones are already our greatest source of disappointment.\nSo I ask you: give my regards to the Mog Squad, and I will see that you are duly compensated for your efforts.\nYou have my sincerest gratitude, Forename. I do not doubt that you will make a fine hunter in the future.\nI am certain that one day I shall be able to weave you into the fabric of our guild, that I shall be able to call upon you for your counsel and inspiration as well.\nUntil that day, I shall continue to pray for your success. And as you go about your business, I shall strive to make you proud. Till we meet again, Forename.']

Dialogue: ['\nWymond:', "It's you! Yes, you! I've been awaiting your return. The gift you've brought me is a treasured memento of my father, who passed away some time ago.\nIt's a silver medallion with a carved face of wymond's mother. It was a gift from her to him on his wedding day, and it's my dearest wish that it be kept safe.\nIt was only a matter of time before my father passed, but now that he's not here to see it, I wanted to at least make his memory live on.\nIt's hard to believe that, even after all these years, he was so excited to be in the world. It's even more heartening to know that his passion for music will never fade.\nI will be sharing the medallion with my dear friend, Ul Thon, at the Wymond's home soon. It's only fitting that they part ways once again.\nIt's only fitting that my dear friend, Ul Thon, should at last be able to hear the medallion's song in its entirety. It's the song that he loved best, and it's the only one he ever played on his ukulele.\nI'll be playing the medallion at my father's funeral, and I hope that it will bring him joy for years to come. And I can think of no better way to honor my father than by sharing this medallion with him.\nPlease, take this medallion to my father. Tell him that I will be praying for his soul, and tell him that I will be eternally grateful for his friendship."]
