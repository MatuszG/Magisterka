Dialogue: ['\nMogok:', "\nAh, adventurer! Might you have a moment?\nAs you may know, a group of bandits has been sighted in the area of late. Some would even say they are allies of the Syndicate─the lawless faction which rules the Steppe.\nI've been tasked with tracking down these bandits and their leaders. While they may be hard to track down on their own, it would make our jobs that much easier if we could have the aid of an accomplished hunter.\nThat's why I would ask you to help me in this. To do so, you'll need to slay three of their beasts─a mammoth, a tusk, and a mammoth tusk.\nThe beasts are to be found in the area south of here─the mammoth being the easiest to find, but the tusk and the tusk are the most difficult to track down.\nOnce you've managed to track down all three, pray deliver them to Mogok. The man will be pleased to receive them.", '\nMogok:', '\nGreetings, hunter. May your journey be safe and swift.', '\nMogok:', '\nAh, you're back! Were you able to find the mammoth, tusk, and mammoth tusk?', '\nMogok:', "\nMy thanks, friend! With this, we can finally move forward with our investigation.\nAs you may have gathered, the Syndicate has a long and bloody history. What's more, they've always been at the forefront of every battle, whether it be against the forces of Garlemald or against the gods themselves.\nWith their leader at the helm, the Syndicate has always been at the forefront of every battle. To think that they even held the Holy See in check...\nIt's hard to fathom, but the Syndicate may have even surpassed Garlemald in their capacity for evil.\nIt's been more than a century since the fall of the Empire, and while the Syndicate may have fallen to their influence, their influence lives on in the form of bandits and brigands who prey on the weak and defenseless.\nI've always found it troubling that the Syndicate has so much power, yet they wield it in such ruthless fashion. It's something which must be addressed if we're to avert a future incident.\nIt's something which must be addressed if we're to avert a future incident. For this, I thank you. Now, let us take our search to the next level─to the realm itself!\nI have a mission for you, hunter. It would mean the world to me if you could bring me back three mammoth tusks.\nMy thanks to you once again, and take heart! I can smell the mammoth tusk already.\nMy next mission will be to track down and retrieve these tusks. Please, hurry, before they're eaten away by some of the world's most ferocious beasts!"]
