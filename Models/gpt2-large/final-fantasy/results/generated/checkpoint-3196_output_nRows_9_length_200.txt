Dialogue: ['\nZlatan:', '\nAccording to Master Gerolt, the means by which emotional energies are committed to the Resistance weapons is perhaps the most crucial aspect of the refinement process.\nSomehow, the House of Splendors has contrived a means to procure crystallized emotions known as reagents.

It would be entirely possible to wait until more are discovered, but it would also be entirely possible to produce a weapon with even more powerful emotions.\nIt should also be noted that, while it is possible to enhance emotional energies through other means, doing so would likely result in a weapon with even more flaws.
