Title: A Brave Resolution
Dialogue: ['\nResistancegatekeeper:', "\nForename Surname, welcome to the House of Splendors! I am Resistancegatekeeper, and I welcome you.\nThere is a matter I would ask of you.\nIn order to ensure the safety of our citizens, we have established a new system through which we collect citizen complaints.\nAlas, some citizens feel that their complaints have no merit, and so they refrain from reporting crimes to the proper authorities.\nSome may see this as a personal attack on my character, but I think it important that those who choose to remain silent be afforded the same opportunity to contest the charges.\nIf there are citizens who wish to make a report, but choose to remain ignorant of the law, I would be most grateful if you would inform them of our new procedure.\n", '\nResistancegatekeeper:', "\nYou have my thanks. The House will be pleased to hear that many who have made complaints have now been resolved, and that many who have been found not guilty have volunteered to speak with you.\nI should also mention that, as a gesture of goodwill, we have established a formal exchange program with the Eorzean Alliance. Citizens who express a wish to engage in commerce with the Resistance may do so at their leisure.\nIf you have any questions, I encourage you to speak with our citizens-to-be. I look forward to your visit!"]
