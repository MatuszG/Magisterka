Dialogue: ['\nGelen:', '\nHello again, traveler! I am glad to see you safe and sound.\nDawson's Spire overlooks the Steel Vigil, where the heroes of old fought to protect the Blessed. For generations, the statue has stood in silent vigil, though we cannot hear the sounds of the city below.\nBut now that the fighting has ended, we can look upon the statue once more with a certain understanding. For it is now a museum, displaying the relics of the heroes who fell there.\nThe “heroes” that once fought for Eorzea, collected and preserved by the Crystal Exarch. They are displayed within the museum, along with countless artifacts from our distant past.\nBefore we speak of any particular hero, however, let us firstly consider their place in the grand scheme of Crystal history.\nA number of them appear in the Crystal Tower, which was created by the Crystal Exarch to present the relics of the heroes who fell there to the people of Eorzea.\nDawson's Spire was chosen as the location of its first exhibition, which was held in the wake of the Garleans' invasion.\nAnd the Exarch intended it as a place where the heroes' relics could be seen and heard, so that the public would understand the significance of what they once stood for.\nAfter all, the heroes of old were not only the most famous of our people, but they are also the most tragic, as well. They tragically met their end at the hands of their fellow Eorzeans.\nAnd so it was that the heroes' relics were placed within the tower, that we might come to understand their sacrifices better.\nAnd it was through the heroes' statues that we learned much of the dangers that threaten our world. It is for these reasons that we keep the heroes' memories alive, that we might bestow upon them a peaceful resting place in the Crystal Exarch.\nBut do not think that all of the heroes who fell there are now at peace. Far from it! In fact, some of them were not so different from you─strong and proud, yet without a shred of heroism to show for it.\nFor instance, there was this man─a native of Eorzea─who refused to stand by idly as his fellow Eorzeans were slaughtered. He refused to stand by when the Crystal Exarch asked him to stand by while they fought.\nAnd thus he stood in the shadow of the heroes, watching and waiting, until the very end was in sight. And when it was, he took up the heroes' weapons and fought in their stead. He fought so hard that eventually he broke both his legs.\nTo this day, he dreams of avenging the heroes' deaths, and has even joined the Crystal Exarch in collecting their relics.\nBut he is far from being a full-fledged member of the Crystal Exarch, and it is not easy for him to accept help from outsiders. Hence why I am here, to help him. I would like you to help as well, traveler.\nPlease go to East Hawkers' Alley in East Hawkers' Alley, and seek out this man. Tell him that you wish to help him, and that he should be given whatever aid he asks for.\nAnd...here, as thanks for your help, is a token of my gratitude.", '\nGelen:', '\nPlease go to East Hawkers' Alley in East Hawkers' Alley, and seek out this man.

I'm sure my friend would be overjoyed to see you, but alas, he's too busy dealing with his own children to see you.\nYou see, Umete was born with a birth defect that prevents him from growing. As a child, he attended a military base in the mountains of South East, where he trained in the techniques of arms and combat.\nAfter he returned home, however, he found that he couldn't make a living as a mercenary. So, in order to put food on the table, he decided to start a business selling used equipment.\nAfter he sold a few of the trinkets to friends and family, he was left with nothing. But, as you can see, it's all he's got. He's constantly begging for more.\nI've been trying to get him to take up the trading trade again, but he's always saying that he needs more to fund his business.\nHe's even tried hiring other people to help with the business, but they always say the same thing. It's like this all the time.\nI'm sure you see where this is going. Eventually, he's going to have to start making money somehow─and that's when he'll have to start looking for new equipment.\nBut, until then, I appreciate you helping me with this. It means a lot."]

It would've been a terrible waste of time had I not been there to retrieve them.\nI'm currently sorting through our surplus from the last harvest, and I was hoping to surprise my friend with something that he hadn't seen before. Something that would bring him back to the old ways.\nI've been saving these seeds for ages, but I've never been able to put them to use. The Crystarium flowers are too precious to be put to good use, you know.\nI'm hoping to put these into flower pots and put them around the village, but I know that I'll never be able to get the necessary flowers to grow if the seed is sitting around collecting dust.\nI'm sure that's what you were thinking, yes? That it would be a terrible waste to throw the seed away, right? That it would be a terrible waste to put the seed to good use?\nRight, then. I'm going to set about sorting through our surplus as quickly as I can. Please hurry. I can't be certain that the flowers are in one of the places they were meant to be delivered..."]
