Perhaps the sting could even be used to stimulate the appetite, or perhaps it would simply be an inconvenience to the beeswax candles' keepers...\nI shall think of a way to incorporate the sting into the candles myself.']

You've arrived with good news, and a plan to boot.\nAfter conferring with our esteemed patrons, we decided to create a beeswax honeybeekeeping facility within the confines of the Imperative.\nAfter a thorough investigation, we determined that the beeswax used in the production of our honeybee syrup is harvested by none other than the parasitic wasp, Apis dorsatus.\nIt is our belief that the wasps have taken the liberty of using the honeybees' natural defenses against us, thereby concealing their presence from our sensors.\nWith the wasps' help, we believe we have devised a plan to eliminate the bees' scent─and thereby render the facility invulnerable to our prying eyes.\nThe wasps' subterranean nest is located in a cave situated to the south of the Imperative. We believe we have located the entrance by which the wasps use their nest as a cover.\nWe shall need you to infiltrate the cave and destroy the entrance before our plan can be implemented.\nA pugilist of your ability would be a tremendous help in this mission.
