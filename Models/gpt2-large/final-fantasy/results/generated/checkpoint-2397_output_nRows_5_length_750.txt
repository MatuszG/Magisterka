It certainly meets the description.\nThe chocobos we receive from the Order are of excellent quality, but it is the arrangements with the breeder that truly sets them apart.\nNot all of the birds are created equal, you see. Some are raised to be naught more than tools, while others are raised to be companions to the master.\nIn the case of the latter, there is no mistaking the bond between the two─an affinity that transcends race and species.\nWhen it comes to the former, though, it is a matter of degree. Some are raised to be companions to the master, but others are only children when they arrive.\nAnd even among the children, some are raised to become full-fledged chocobos, while others are abandoned to the wilds and raised as beasts.\nIt is through the kindness of the breeder that we are able to receive the birds we covet. The Order has a responsibility to nurture the fledgling chocobos until they are strong enough to take their place alongside their masters in the world.\nAnd that is why I am indebted to you. When you helped bring me my beloved chocobos, I had no idea that you would be willing to accept them into your home. I thank you from the bottom of my heart."]

Dialogue: ['\nGildon:', "\nAh, Forename. So good of you to come!\nA pleasure to make your acquaintance.\n...What would a “gleaner” be without an “asker”? A trader, perhaps?\nI suppose you can answer that. They are those men and women who, through trade with distant lands, come to purchase items from our shores.\nThere are many types of gleaner, but the most common are those who deal in rare items─crystals, for example.\nI am told you are quite well acquainted with the concept. If you would agree to aid us with one of these hunts, you would gain valuable experience.\nI would have you seek out the creatures which roam near the shores of Loch Seld. You will find them by the large rocks east of the village.\nOnce you have located one of these beasts, I would ask that you bring it to me.\nHm? Why, that is a rather difficult question to answer!

Indeed, it is clear that it was created for ceremonial purposes only.\nNevertheless, its beauty is undeniable. I can only hope that it serves you well in your future hunts.\n...You have a gift for me, Forename. Would you be willing to trade it with me?\nBy way of payment, you will receive a crystal from me. I would have you offer it to an ally of mine.\nThe creature you seek is the shaggy mammoth, the kin of the primals.\nBy my calculation, I believe that it is within your ability to procure the mammoth's tusks for yourself.\nLocate the shaggy mammoth, and offer it to my ally, the alchemist named Aanuvanu. You will receive a mammoth tusk from him, as well as a crystal.\nAh, you have returned. Were you able to complete the transaction?\nBy my calculation, the transaction was successful! Now, let us return to the village and share this with our allies.\n...And that concludes our “gleaner” quest! I hope you will continue to spread word of our success!\n"]

We believe that the answer is a resounding 'yes.'\nWith this in mind, we shall explain the nature of its secondary effect.\nAccording to our understanding, the weapon's destructive potential is enhanced when a certain “etherial bond” exists between the weapon and the wielder.\nAs a weapon's destructive potential increases, so too does the wielder's bond with it deepen. Thus, the more powerful the weapon, the stronger the bond between wielder and weapon.\nWhen this occurs, the weapon's properties change─and this change is irreversible. Hence why we have chosen to refer to it as a “blessed tool.”\nWith the blessing of the elementals in mind, we shall next describe the manner in which the weapon's properties change when the wielder attains a new state of affinity with it.\nWhen the elementals bless the weapon, they entrust it with certain unique properties. These properties are based upon the elementally resonant link between wielder and weapon.\nWhen the elementals grant the blessing, they entrust the weapon with certain unique properties.

Title: A Bold Decision
Dialogue: ['\nAnantasister:', "\nI'm sorry, friend, but I'm afraid I cannot in good conscience leave my post at the moment.\nI was assigned to this post because I possessed a certain...interest in─and I speak fluent─Dotharl. I couldn't bear to disappoint my superiors.\nBut to make matters worse, the man I was sent to investigate has suddenly vanished!\nI've tried to follow him but he has run off in the direction of the eastern watchtower. It's not a stretch to say that he is either fleeing for his life or that he is dead.\nI can hardly take it on my own, but if you see him, would you try to locate him? He should be somewhere in western Thanalan.", '\nAnantasister:', '\nIf you are able to locate my colleague, would you try to locate him? He should be somewhere in western Thanalan.', '\nAnantasister:', '\nYou have found him!? Thank you, friend. You have saved him from certain death.\nMy colleague was last spotted heading east, towards the eastern watchtower. Please hurry and inform the garrison that he must be returned to the capital.', '\nAnantasister:', '\nMy colleague has gone to the eastern watchtower.

I only hope that his body has not been ravaged by the cold.\nIn any case, he confirmed that there are three Dotharl living in the ruins─one male, one female, and a newborn. All three are apparently orphaned by the Calamity.\nThe males were most severely affected, and it is said that they are unable to reproduce for some time. I can hardly bring myself to leave them there any longer.\nThe newborn is yet to be named, but I hope that in the near future it will be given a proper name.\nI must warn you, however, that these ruins are fraught with danger. Do not take too kindly to those who try to steal your belongings.\nYou have my sincerest gratitude, friend. I can hardly thank you enough."]

Dialogue: ['\nEstrild:', '\nWell, it is about time you ventured outside the castle.\nAs you know, the dragons are restless─to the point that they have even been spotted near the water─and this has created a dangerous situation for the castle.\nThat is why I have asked Master Gegeruju to send a boat to ferry us out to the island in the southwest.\nI am confident that the dragons will not attack until we arrive, however, and the thought of a panicked moogle fleeing to the water has my nerves on edge...\nPlease, take this large pot of rice. I do not need you to hunt down a single dragon, but if you can take down three or so, we will have our man.', '\nEstrild:', '\nPlease take the rice to Master Gegeruju. It is just to the north of here.', '\nEstrild:', '\nI trust you will be all right?', '\nEstrild:', "\nAye, I'm fairly certain that the dragons will not attack until we arrive. I can't imagine they would wait for us here, however, considering their history with the water...", '\nEstrild:', '\nMaster Gegeruju has done a fine job of keeping us on guard. We have been fortunate to have you along.\nI hope that this rice is enough to last us until we return. I shall see to preparing our meals in the meantime.']
