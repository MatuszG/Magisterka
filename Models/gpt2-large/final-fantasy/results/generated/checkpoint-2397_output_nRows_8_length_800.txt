We've been using a unique variety of secretion from the honeybee to attract pollinators, but in order to make it more effective, we need to make use of its natural defenses.\nYou see, the bees themselves are covered in tiny, needlelike structures called honeybees' legs. While the legs themselves are quite small, their exoskeleton is quite large─something we've been trying to replicate.\nUnfortunately, the solution we came up with required far more work to be complete─which is why I'm pleased to say that I've finally succeeded in isolating the key to our success: beeswax!\nI used beeswax candles to lure the bees to our location, but they're the perfect bait for the beehive's natural defenses.\nNow, as you probably already know, beeswax candles are essentially crystallized beeswax. They contain a blend of ingredients that are ideal for protecting the bees' exoskeleton─which is what beeswax is actually used for, after all.\nIn short, beeswax is an ideal solution for protecting our beehives─and I mean that in the literal sense, of course.\nIn any case, I would very much like your help in taking my solution to the next level.

Should any of our fellows come to harm, we are trained to respond as one.\nIt is no exaggeration to say that without such a firm foundation, even the smallest of movements could result in disaster.\nWith such a firm foundation, we can perform the most mundane tasks with aplomb.\nFor example, one might craft a blanket that will shelter a trapped traveler from the elements, or a makeshift bow to pierce the thickest of hides.\nSuch mundane tasks, however, require no special talent or training. You need only possess an instrument of pure crystal that can perform them.\nIt is for this reason that we have forged ties with the more technologically advanced races. Those of us who favor a more traditional approach may choose to train our weapons and armor by hand, but we do not neglect our efforts to forge links with the outside world.\nThe forging of ties with the outside world is not a task that can be performed by one individual alone, however.

Title: A Breath of Respite
Dialogue: ['\nLalai:', "\nI have spoken with Master Surname. I am pleased to inform you that the House Dzemael knight spoke with you on the matter of the crystal.\nIt was an enlightening discussion, one which I hope will serve to further refine our understanding of the Ishgardian crystal's nature.\nIn the meanwhile, I would ask that you assist my lord in his endeavor to procure more crystals.\nI would ask you procure four crystals from the ruins northwest of the Dzemael Deepcroft─one for each Ishgardian element─and deliver them to Master Surname for further study.\nI am certain that his research will ultimately lead him to the answer we seek, but I hope that he may use the crystals to further refine his understanding of the crystal's nature.", '\nSurname:', '\nDid you have a chance to chat with Master Lalai? If so, would you be willing to help my lord further investigate the crystals?', '\nSurname:', "\nBy the Twelve, this is the crystallized essence of the element─a crystal which transcends the boundaries of space and time.\nI knew I had found a true Ishgardian crystal, but I had no idea that it could be this massive.\nI am not certain how it came to be in these ruins, but it is likely that the elementals dwelling within were drawn to the power of the crystal.\nWhatever their reasons were, the elementals were drawn to its destructive power, and so it was left to lie dormant until the last moment before the Calamity.\nWhile I can only speculate as to what role the elementals may have played, I am grateful that the crystal gave us the time to act before it was too late.\nIt is no exaggeration to say that a single crystal has the power to heal the dying, revive the dead, and even grant the holder all manner of protection─even if we do not fully understand the exact nature of the crystal's power.\nIn any case, it is a tremendous gift that the elementals chose to dwell in these ruins. I would ask that you keep it in your heart, that you would cherish its memories always.\nI am grateful for your continued assistance, sir. I pray that you will use the crystal to its fullest potential in the future."]

Dialogue: ['\nAlys:', "You've returned! Please, allow me to thank you for your assistance.\nI must say, I was rather impressed by your swiftness and dependability. It would not have been possible for me to secure the necessary assistance if you hadn't answered my urgent summons.\nWith that, I would like to express my gratitude to you once more. Now, if you will excuse me, I would do some further research on how best to improve my bow.\nLest you worry, I will not be teaching you how to shoot this time. It would be far more beneficial to discuss the subject matter in greater depth with one of your peers.\nYour assistance has been more than welcome, but I would like you to know that I am confident that I can handle any further questions you may have regarding the archery discipline.\nI am indebted to you for volunteering your time. I hope you will continue to contribute to the archery community in the future!"]
