I've a feeling you'll do the same."]

Aye, I have a task for you.\nI have been asked to inspect a train that was recently constructed for the express purpose of transporting people to Limsa Lominsa. The train has been well-maintained, but the air that permeates the carriages is foul.\nIt is to be my job to remove any stagnant fumes from the carriages, but I have no desire to leave my post.\nWould you mind assisting me?\nI have marked on your map a location which is to be the point of departure. Please, go and see if there are any problems.', '\nAimebert:', '\nThe air that permeates the carriages is stagnant. Please see if there are any problems there.', '\nAimebert:', '\nYou have returned, and with good tidings?', '\nAimebert:', "\nAh, so you're the one who's been helping me with the cleaning. I was hoping to have someone from outside the station to help with the inspection.\nI have marked on your map a location which is to be the point of departure. Please, go and see if there are any problems there."]

Dialogue: ['\nMordoyaz:', "\nAdventurer, you have come to deliver a gift for a brave adventurer, have you?\nIn the past, I have sent envoys to the realm of Gridania, but you are the first to make a suitable impression. I must congratulate you on a job well done.\nAfter all, the adventurer who carries out our requests is our only hope for the future.\nYou are familiar with the envoys, yes? You must be curious as to what has become of them.\nIf you wish to know more, pray speak with Eilis at the gates of the House of Splendors. I will direct you to the House of Splendors itself.", '\nEilis:', '\nA letter, adventurer. I presume Mordoyaz sent you to ask about our envoys?', '\nEilis:', "\nI see... It seems I have been asked to explain a bit more.\nThe envoys are tasked with fulfilling requests that our House of Splendors receives from foreign nations.\nIn order to fulfill these requests, they travel to places such as the Dravanian Horde, the Dravanian Forename, and the Dravanian Umbran─all of which are known for their horrifically violent inhabitants.\nA number of our envoys have been wounded in the process, which has made travel difficult for them.\nWith all of these dangerous places on our list of requisition, I imagine it has become difficult for them to choose which ones they wish to visit.\nAfter much deliberation, however, they decided to travel to the Dravanian Horde.\nIn the past, I have been concerned that the Dravanian Horde would be drawn to such a place.\nHowever, I now believe that they will not be drawn in by such an enticing offer.\nBut I do not mean to say that they will not come. They are not averse to the prospect, and I do not doubt that they have already made up their minds.\nMordoyaz has always been fond of telling adventurers their adventures. For this particular letter, however, he has asked you to recount your own.\nI imagine that he has already decided which requests he wishes to fulfill, and I do not doubt that he is eager to hear about yours.\nNow then, let us begin.\nThe Dravanian Horde is said to dwell in the Dravanian Peaks.\nIn order to reach the Peaks, they must first pass through the Dravanian Subterrane.\nIt should come as no surprise that the envoys have been instructed to choose routes through which to traverse the Dravanian Subterrane.\nI imagine that the envoys have already made up their minds, and I do not doubt that they have already made up their minds.\nIn any case, I wish to see you in the Dravanian Peaks.
