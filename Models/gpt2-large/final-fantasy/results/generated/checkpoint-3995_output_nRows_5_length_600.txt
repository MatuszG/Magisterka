And so it was that the Dusk Choral was born.\nCompleted some two decades ago, the palace was meant to serve as a symbol of the Dawn Throne's unity. But then the unthinkable happened─the beastmen came.\nNo one is certain for what purpose the Dusk Choral was constructed, but some say it was used as a crude weapons research facility.\nWhatever the truth may be, it is certain that it will not be used to threaten the people of Ishgard. No, the Dusk Choral will be used to unite, as Lady Iceheart so aptly described it.\nNow, before the ceremony can take place, the choral must be blessed by the lord commander. And I can think of no better person to do so than you, my friend.\nI will take myself to the Dusk Throne at once!\nYou have my sincerest gratitude, and I hope you enjoy the ceremony as much as I do!", '\nAlphinaud:', '\nYour presence is a most welcome one, my friend.\nIndeed, Iceheart herself spoke of your capabilities. This will be an opportunity for you to hone your arts, I trust?\nAh, but of course! I had even contemplated paying you a visit myself, but that notion is now naught but a dream.\nLady Iceheart, I am certain that you are capable of wielding the Dusk Choral as you see fit. If you will excuse me, I must make haste to attend to preparations for the ceremony.', '\
