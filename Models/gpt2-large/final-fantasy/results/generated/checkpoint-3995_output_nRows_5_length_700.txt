When I got to the island, however, I found that my plan had changed.\nI was meant to take it to Isari, but the roads weren't safe. I needed someone I could trust, and I couldn't turn to the Yellowjackets for assistance.\nI knew I could count on you, friend. As long as you're here, I'll see this matter through.", '\nGildon:', "You've already solved the aurochs problem? Wonderful! It's only a matter of time before the killer is revealed.\nAnd then, of course, comes the matter of the bloody auroch. That fiend is bound to be very important, and we'll have to put a good face on it.\nTo be perfectly frank, I've had second thoughts about helping you.

In a previous life, I was a member of the Sultansworn elite, one of the most renowned warriors of my time. It was not easy, but I persevered, working tirelessly for the good of my nation.\nBut after I left the army, something changed. I became a trader, and it was there that I found my new calling. I decided to focus solely on arms dealing, selling what I had made to those in Ul'dah who need what I can provide.\nI have not forgotten my former life, and I would not take it away. But I would like you to understand this: if I cannot convince the people of my homeland that I am worthy of a place on the negotiating table, then I will not be party to the negotiations.\nSo you see, I require a capable adversary to help me in my negotiations.

There is one thing that I know for certain─and that is the word of the Roegadyn.\nWhen I heard that the sultana had been captured, my heart nearly stopped.\nBut to have her father confess that he forced his hand is far more troubling.
