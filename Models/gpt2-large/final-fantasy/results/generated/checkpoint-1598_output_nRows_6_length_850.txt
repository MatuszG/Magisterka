I would ask you to collect three of these crystals and place them in the hollow of this instrument.\nThe crystals are found by the wandering minotaurs.

These crystals are used to preserve them.\nUnfortunately, the memories of the past are mixed with other memories. The more memories there are, the more difficult it becomes to preserve the memories of the present.\nIn order to help preserve the memories of the present, the hollow is sometimes referred to as the “chamber of memories.”\nI am sure that you are aware of the difficulties involved in placing the memories, but I have the honor of seeing to it that they are stored in the best possible manner.\nAs for the memories of the past, we have no use for them. If they are to be used for anything, they should be placed with those of the present.\nNow, the hollow is where we store our memories. Please place the memories in the chamber of memories.\nI know you will be eager to do so, but I ask that you take care not to forget to do so.\nFor a moment, I feared that the memories of the past had been lost forever. I had been certain that they would never be retrieved.\nBut thanks to you, I now know that there is still much to be done.\nI should mention that this instrument has a special meaning for me. It was my first attempt at alchemic creation.\nMy father was one of the first to join the Doman resistance. He fought bravely until he was wounded in battle. I was orphaned at a young age.\nI took up residence at the Blessed Arcanum in an attempt to raise my father's spirits.\nI have been looking forward to seeing him again. I hope that he will remember the joy he felt when he first set foot in Ala Mhigo.\nI hope that he will also feel pride in his home.\nAlas, I have no one else to whom I can entrust this.

Dialogue: ['\nDmitar:', '\nWe have a problem, Blade Surname. A problem that requires an urgent solution.\nThe situation on the southern front has deteriorated to the point where we are faced with a dire situation.\nThe enemy is massing forces to the west of Castrum Centri, which means we must move quickly to destroy them.\nBut I fear that may prove difficult in light of recent developments on the front line.\nWe have established a new system for assigning objectives to our soldiers.\nThis system was devised to make it easier to coordinate our efforts on the battlefield, but I fear it has produced a rather unexpected result.\nYour task is to destroy the enemy forces to the west of Castrum Centri.\nThe enemy forces to the west of Castrum Centri can be found in the area of the crater to the west of our position. You should begin your search there.', '\nSoldiera:', '\nAh, there you are. Might you perchance be able to spare a moment?\nWe were expecting an attack on our position from the south.

I must confess, I was expecting you.\nAs for the objective, I suppose it is fairly straightforward. I need you to destroy the enemy forces to the west of Castrum Centri.', '\nSoldierd:', "\nI have heard you have established a system for assigning objectives to your soldiers.\nI have a feeling we'll be working together again on the battlefield. Thank you for your help today.\nI have not heard from my commanding officer since our last operation. I hope he has something good to tell me.\nI've heard reports of fierce fighting on the southern front. I can't say I've been paying attention, but I hope it won't be too long before we meet again."]
