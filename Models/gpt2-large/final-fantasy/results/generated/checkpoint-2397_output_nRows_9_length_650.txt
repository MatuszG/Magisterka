To this end, I would ask you to remove three eggs from the nest and place them in a nest box.\nNow, there is no telling what effect this will have on the chocobos, but if you would have us do anything, you must do it yourself!

The largest, and most aggressive, are the Apepata.\nThe smallest and most docile are the Elepata.\nIt is my understanding that the pescatarians feed off of the energy released by the nearby lightning. Given time, this energy accumulates, and they become quite dangerous.\nYou are fortunate you came across my friend before that energy accumulates, otherwise I would have been forced to hunt you myself. But thank you, friend. You have saved me from certain death.', '\nMogmont:', '\nYou are safe here─I will be watching over you.

You're here because you want to know more about the Kholus? Well, I suppose it would only be fair if you read this first!\n...Now, before we get to that, let's talk a little about the history of the Kholus.\nIt was here that our ancestors first settled, and─\nWait a minute! You didn't hear that from me!? Well, if you didn't get it from me, you're a bloody fool!\nThe Kholus were originally a people of great strength and cunning. They built their city upon a huge plateau of crystal─which is what gives the whole place its name.\nBut then, all of a sudden, the people of the Crystarium started attacking the Kholus. It was during this time that the Kholus decided to turn to magic, and so they built magnificent magitek armor to protect themselves.\nThey even had magitek cannons that could shoot down an approaching Miqo'te. But to make matters worse, the Kholus' leader at the time, U'odh Nunh, was caught in the middle of a conflict that raged across the whole of Vylbrand.\nNeedless to say, he had no choice but to flee to the Crystarium, where he remained until he was rescued by the Kholus.\nAfter U'odh Nunh came back to the Kholus, he built a magnificent new city upon the plateau, where he named it after himself. And that is how the Kholus came to be.\nNow, the Kholus are a proud and proud people. They pride themselves on being masters of magitek weaponry, and they're always searching for new ways to improve their weapons.\nThat's why I was so excited to hear that you were interested in joining our ranks!\nYou'll be joining us in our efforts to improve the magitek weaponry of the Kholus!? Well, I can hardly wait to get started!\n...But first, I must ask that you take this armor with you when you depart. It's a gift from the commander─you'll be richly rewarded if you part with it!\n...Right, then. I'm sure you're eager to find out more, so let's continue on!"]

They were a great civilization and one of our ancestors even rose to become a nunh.\nTo this day, they are home to many a fascinating structure. However, their history is shrouded in mystery.\nThat is why I am more than happy to turn to you for assistance.

Let us see if we can piece together what has become of them.', '\nSorocan:', '\nWere you able to find anything out there?', '\nSorocan:', "\nHmmm. Interesting. I will take a closer look when I have a better look at this stone tablet.\nI am positive it is the record of the ancient Ananta. It is written in the ancient language and is addressed to a certain individual.\nAccording to the record, this person was an elder of the tribe, and they dedicated a great temple to him.\nAs this is the first time we have heard of such a temple, it is highly likely that the person in question was a nunh.\nWe may have even found his remains. He may still be alive, waiting for his successor to take his place.\nAs the elder's heir, he would have been expected to have a say in the selection of a successor, and we are happy to have an ally in our fight.\nMy thanks for your help.
