I understand my duties come first, but I must also protect these creatures.\nIn order to do so, however, I must needs procure a certain aetherial material, which can be found by searching the forest floor.\nI would be grateful if you would search the area just northwest of here, where a number of burrowing bees have been observed to gather. Two should be sufficient. Oh, and do make sure to bring back their aetherial material, as well.', '\nTotonowa:', '\nAh, you are returned. Were you able to find two of the creatures I asked for?\nVery good. With this, I can finally complete my research.\nI had intended to use this aetherial material to improve the creatures' natural defenses, but they have proven to be rather erratic...\nWhile this may seem inconsequential, a single mistake can have disastrous consequences.\nFortunately, we have managed to isolate the problem. By feeding the creatures a concoction containing a mix of myxaion and a host of beneficial insects, I am confident that this excess aether will be neutralized, thereby rendering them defenseless against myxomata.\nIf all goes according to plan, the Entwined Serpents may one day be of use to the forest.

Dialogue: ['\nSeverian:', "\nAh, it is good of you to come. My friend told me all about your bravery in battle.\nI would ask you a question, if I may. Might you be able to tell me more of your harrowing journey?\nI heard the Kojin of the Red passing through on their way to Doma Castle. While they made it clear they wished to join our fight against the Empire, there was a sentiment within the tribe that they wished to preserve their own way of life.\nSome even went so far as to say they would rather not part with their weapons.\nAnd so I asked myself─would I be better off dying in battle rather than surrendering my life to the Empire? The answer was no.\nBut I am not so foolish as to think that my answer means I am not worthy of a peaceful life in peace. For a Kojin to say they wish to fight is no mere gesture. They mean to say they are willing to die.\nWhich brings me to the issue at hand. You see, it has been my wish to discuss the matter with my fellow Kojin. I have sent word to the Immortal Flames, but they have yet to return with an answer.\nI am loath to send you into a battle of this scale without first verifying your intent. I would be most appreciative if you could wait for me by the west gates of Doma Castle.\nWhen you arrive, pray seek out my friend and tell him of my wish. I will not take my absence for granted. I will not take my brother's life for granted.\nI have made my decision. I will not surrender myself to the Empire.", '\nRedolentrose:', '\nSir, we have received word from Severian. He wishes to speak with you.\nSeverian is at your service. He awaits you at the west gates of Doma.', '\nSeverian:', '\nWhen I hear the answer I am certain to be elated.

Dialogue: ['\nHinuvali:', "\nWelcome to Vira Nilya, Master Surname. If you have a moment, I would share with you my most remarkable news.\nJust yesterday, I received a letter from the home of one Cid Garlond, the proprietor of the Drowning Wench. The man writes that his wife has just given birth to a healthy baby boy!\nCid is an old friend of mine, and a father of my children besides. I had long intended to make him proud by placing a special order for his baby, but... The woman I love has just given birth to a child! And I can scarce believe it. Cid's a great man, and a great grandfather of mine besides. But I cannot in good conscience force him to meet my demand.\nBut I fear that if I speak my mind, he may feel compelled to oblige me... Might he even turn his back on me!? I know nothing of the world beyond these rooftops. But I will think of a way to have him deliver the baby in my stead, and in the meantime, I would ask that you speak with Garlond in my stead. If you can spare the time, I would be most grateful if you could speak with him in my stead.", '\nGarlond:', "\nA pleasure to meet you, Forename. My wife gave birth to a healthy baby boy not too long ago. He's a healthy boy, and quite adorable besides.\nIt's only natural that my mind would be filled with worry when the world seems so unfamiliar, but a father has to look after his family no matter what. And I'm sure Cid will understand.\nIn any case, I should be receiving my order in the next few days. It won't be long until the new baby is here. In the meantime, I ask that you see him born into the world. I'll be waiting near the Drowning Wench."]

Dialogue: ['\nSeverian:', '\nAh, I spy a familiar face among the refugees! And what would a familiar face be doing in a place like this?\nYou see, I was hired by the Order of the Twin Adder to recruit adventurers─fresh meat in a sack. I was to bring these very same adventurers to Amh Araeng, where they would be given a brief tour of the city and then sent on their way.\nThe job was made a little difficult by the fact that the refugees I was sent to the west of here have been absolutely unkind to me. They mean well, but they also have a penchant for showing their teeth when they talk.\nSo I was faced with the difficult decision of either attempting to reason with them─a move that might backfire and end poorly─or making an offering in their stead. And I had to choose between my dignity and my life.\nThe offering, you see, is a token of my gratitude to the people of Amh Araeng─and a token of my hope that they will one day forgive my many transgressions.\nI had hoped that my offering would bring the refugees some solace, but instead they have chosen to make me suffer for their misdeed. I daresay it would be best for both parties if I could simply leave this place.\nBut you are a traveler, and it would not be prudent of me to leave you waiting. If you would be so kind as to wait on me, I would be ever so grateful!', '\nSeverian:', '\nAh, you are returned. I trust you were able to find my refugees?\nWonderful! I have never seen such a promising group of recruits! I can only imagine the amount of coin they will be earning when they are sent out into the world!\nIt is but a pity they have been so cruel to me. I am forever in your debt.']

I realize it is hardly a looker, but the creatures we see off the water are so fascinating. Would you mind if I asked you to take this lantern to the north pier?\nThe lantern is needed for our work. It illuminates the waters to the north, creating a barrier that keeps out the Sahagin.\nWe can't have men swimming in the dark, so this lantern illuminates the waters to the north. I think it will be very handy. Now, would you mind taking it to the north pier?', '\nGinnade:', '\nThank you for bringing me the lantern.
