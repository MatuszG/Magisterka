Dialogue: ['\nMogmont:', "\nI see you've made it back in one piece, Forename. The rest of your preparations are proceeding apace, and it's just about time I had a chat with you.\nYou see, I've had a hunch for a while now that you'd be the perfect man to take on this task.\nI'm certain you've had your share of battles and hardship.\nBut to have done so well at the same time, and done it well, is impressive enough.\nI have yet to meet anyone more skilled than you, Forename, and I know you'll do the world a favor by assisting me.\nI would ask that you take to the task, and bring me the beeswax candles you've used.\nThe candles will allow you to burn a candle in a hive of beeswax, which is the most abundant and most effective substance found in nature.\nIn the absence of any other suitable source of the substance, beeswax candles can be obtained by collecting them from nests in the vicinity.\nIf you'd rather not use the candles, you can always procure them from a merchant by way of the Bismarck Exchange.\nAs you may have noticed, the Exchange is a place where you can buy and sell all manner of things.\nWhen you come here, however, you may be surprised to see the number of traders who come and go.\nI would ask you to keep an eye out for any who are in the market for beeswax candles. I hope you can find some for me.", '\nMogmont:', '\nOh, and just for the record, this is not the first time you've helped me. I was once a merchant myself, and I had to fight hard to earn my livelihood.']

Dialogue: ['\nAlphinaud:', "\nYou're back already. You don't look like you're in much of a rush to get back to your post.\nI suppose I can ask you a few more questions...\nI was just thinking about the situation in which the refugees from the Dravanian Horde are stranded in the Twelveswood, and I'm not sure what else to ask of you.\nIf you're willing, I would be grateful if you could go and see if the refugees are still alive?\nI should note that I should probably warn you that I haven't been able to return to my post since the incident.\nI haven't had a chance to rest since the evacuation, and I'm afraid I'm going to have to remain here and watch and wait for my men to return.", '\nAlphinaud:', '\nI would be grateful if you could go and see if the refugees are still alive.', '\nAlphinaud:', "\nSo you've been able to find the refugees?\nGood. I should probably tell you a little something about them.\nThey're refugees, mostly from Dravanian Horde lands. They're part of the Alliance of Free Peoples, which is a loose alliance of nations that have been negotiating peace with the Dravanians since the Calamity.\nWe believe that we have a right to be here, and we will not be permitted to leave.\nThe refugees are treated very well by the Alliance, and we've been given much to do.\nThe refugees, for their part, are in fact, a large part of our nation's economy.\nThe refugees are a part of the Alliance, but they're not part of our nation. They're refugees, and they're here to stay.\nThey're a part of our nation, but they're not part of our nation. They're refugees, and they're here to stay.\nThey're a part of our nation, but they're not part of our nation. They're refugees, and they're here to stay.\nWe have not been given the right to leave. We have been given a right to stay.\nBut we can't stay here any longer. The Alliance has asked for the refugees to be taken to the Twelveswood.\nThere's a lot of work to be done, but I would be lying if I said it wasn't difficult.\nI have no regrets about what happened. I will do all in my power to help them.\nBut I want to be the one who helps them. I want to be the one who brings them peace. I want to help them.\nIf you would be so kind as to go and see for myself? You would be doing us a great service."]

Dialogue: ['\nAlys:', "\nThat was fast. I'm sure you've noticed how much faster you are than everyone else around here.\nI must apologize to you, Forename─as a matter of fact, I would like to thank you personally.\nI had a dream that I would be able to meet your kind. I was a youngling when I first came here─I would go to the village and pick up as many crumbs as I could.\nI was never able to make it back to the village, however. I was so hungry that I was afraid to stop and eat. I had no idea who you were, and so I asked a traveler from the village if he could bring me back some crumbs.\nHe said he would deliver them to me. Then I thought to myself, how long have I been here? How long have I been waiting for someone to bring me back crumbs?\nI could only think of one person who would be able to do this for me. That person is you, Forename. I cannot wait to ask you to deliver me some crumbs.", '\nAlys:', '\nYou have my thanks, Forename! I will be sure to thank you again when I next visit.']
