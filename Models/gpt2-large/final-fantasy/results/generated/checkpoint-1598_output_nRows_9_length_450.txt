I was the Falcon of the Shroud from the moment I stepped foot in the Shroud, and I'm proud to say I was the first to brave the fearsome beasts that roam the Shroud.\nBut I must say, I think you've taken your fair share of beatings along the way. Not all of them fair, mind you.

It's got wings the size of a man's fist and a pair of massive eyeballs that can pierce even the thickest of steel.\nIf you're ready when the time is ripe, it'll be your turn to face it. And when it's finally down to the final blow, do remember to aim with your─\nWait! Wait! Wait! Don't hit me! Don't hit me!\nAh! Gods, that hurt so good!

I must say, it's quite something to see the Falcon of the Shroud in battle again!\nI suppose I should be glad to have seen the last of that fiendish monstrosity... I hope the knowledge of your bravery helps you on your way.\nThe Shroud is an unforgiving place, but if you've the strength to face the
