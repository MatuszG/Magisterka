Mayhap you could retrieve its fruit for me?', '\nHabitat Designer:', '\nYou have returned with the nectar? Splendid! I shall add it to the pile of flowers I prepared earlier.\nThe second phase of the selection process is the preparation of the nectar. I shall take it to my colleague, who will add it to the flower pot.\nThe flower-fuze is the most critical part of my work. I must make certain that it is properly prepared before attempting to molt a new creation.\nYou will find it in the Apiary to the south. Please hurry─the process must be finished before the next moon.']

Dialogue: ['\nLad Kenn:', "Greetings, honored familiar. I am glad you are here to hear me out. I am Kenn Gyuf, a trained performer and teacher of the wood.\nEver since the advent of the Seventh Umbral Era, I have devoted my life to the study of song. While it is a field in which I am wholly proficient, music has always been my greatest passion.\nToday, however, I would share with you an experience which has made me even more intimate with the wood.\nAs a member of the Buduga tribe, I was blessed with a son. We named him after the guardian deity of our tribe, a being who keeps watch over our home and protect our interests.\nHowever, in order to pass on his sacred title, the boy was forced to undergo a metamorphosis. In order to do so, he was imbued with the properties of a crystal.\nWhen he was five years old, however, his crystal began to crack. The pain was so great that it tore through his body, leaving him unable to bear a single sound for the rest of his life.\nThough he fought to protect his village and his future, the boy could not bear the grief of losing his only child. He could only bear silence.\nAs a result, he has spent his entire life since then listening to only the music that is composed by our Viis.\nIt is, however, something that has become increasingly difficult to do of late. Not only are the fragments of my crystal unable to sustain his ears, but he is also unable to move his lips.\nIt has become increasingly difficult for me to perform as I have grown older. As such, I have begun to look upon the wood in a different light. I now understand why you so readily resonate with it.\nI am, of course, still very much a craftsman. But now I believe that music can provide us with the means to pass on our traditions and to stimulate our emotions.\nThe music we play in our homes, the instruments we play, and the stories we tell are all creations of the wood.\nAs such, I feel a great responsibility to continue to nurture this fine piece of art. As such, I would like to present to you this hunting log.\nAs a Viis, it is our duty to protect the trees of our home. However, we often find ourselves drawn to the insects, plants, and other living things that dwell in our environment.\nIf these things are to be kept safe, we must be the ones to protect them. And so I have created this log to aid me in doing so. Please take it to your hands and do what you can to preserve our traditions.\nI am, of course, still very much a craftsman.

It is a small token, but it will allow you to hear me speak to you personally.\nWhen you have received it, please bring it to me. I would like to hear what you have learned from it.\nPlease accept this as a token of my thanks. It is a small token, but it will allow you to hear me speak to you personally.\n"]

I knew I could count on you.\nWhen you come of age, you are expected to serve in the service of a house for the rest of your life.\nBut as I mentioned before, there is no substitute for live combat experience.\nAnd thanks to you, our knight contingent has a wealth of experience that they can draw from.\nIt would not do to send a single soldier into the field without a sufficient number of drills.\nToday's training regimen is no different.\nYou will begin with a light warmup. After that, you will do some light hitting. After that, you will do some light kicking. After that, you will do some light jumping.\nEach of these drills is intended to teach you a new movement. The order is: light, jumping, and then running. After each of these movements, you will practice a new technique.\nThe first three movements are all about getting your feet wet. The next three are all about getting your body and joints ready for the next movement.\nI hope you will find them all equally challenging, but I suspect you will find them all equally rewarding, no?\nI cannot wait to see what you will do on the battlefield.\nI look forward to seeing you again when you are ready to take the field. Till then, Forename."]

This sense is what gives us our names and gives our actions their purpose.\nAnd so I ask you, Forename: what is the purpose of this “official duty” you speak of?\nNot long ago, I was asked by a wealthy merchant if I would attend him for tea. Upon inquiring as to the nature of my official duties, he responded by saying that he needed someone to provide him with counsel. I agreed to meet him.\nAfter a pleasant drive in his car, we arrived at his manor. He then proceeded to inform me of some pressing business that I was asked to attend. As I readily agreed to do, I soon found myself pondering the purpose of my official duties.\nThen, just when I thought I had come to a conclusion, he suddenly shifted the subject. He began to recount some of the things he had discussed, and it dawned upon me.\nThe purpose of my official duties, he said, was to “provide counsel to the ruler of a neighboring nation.” I felt compelled to agree to his request, as I do not feel comfortable discussing such sensitive matters with an outsider.\nNow, I am not certain what purpose this “consultation” had, but I can tell you that it was not the purpose of my meeting with the merchant.\nHowever, what is important is that he did not attempt to dupe me. He simply explained the situation, and I did not ask for an explanation. Now, go and find out for yourself what my official duties entail.

I was hoping you might come along.\nIt seems my research on the sylphs has caught the attention of a gifted young scholar.\nWould you be willing to assist me in gathering more of their knowledge?\nI will make it worth your while by sharing with you my findings on their culture and their rituals.\nWhen I first began my work on the sylphs, I was forbidden from speaking with anyone save for my supervisor. But now that I have reason to speak with you, I believe it would be best if I explain what my work means to me.\nI will begin by sharing with you information on their culture.\nSylphs primarily use magic to commune with the spirits of nature─such as the wind, lightning, and rain─and to prepare for their future.\nThe knowledge of these spirits is shared amongst the tribe, as well as with outsiders such as you.\nThe sylphs also revere nature spirits such as the sprites that roam the forest floor. In turn, these spirits are referred to as sprites, a term which serves to distinguish them from the other living beings.\nThe sylphs also believe that the souls of the deceased can return to the living. This is why they honor the dead with various ceremonies and offerings.\nWhile it is difficult to glean much information from traditional methods such as talking, listening, and observing, it would be a great help to have reliable data at our disposal.\nNow, then, what do you think? Do you think the sylphs have valuable knowledge to share?\nWonderful! I shall continue my research on these subjects and share what I have learned with you as soon as I am able.\nPlease allow me to explain the purpose of my work in more detail once we have gathered the necessary data.\n“To learn of another tribe's customs and way of life,” you say? Quite fascinating! I will certainly try to learn more of theirs.\n...Oh, that was rather long. I have been reflecting on my findings.\nI believe I owe you an apology. While my research is focused on the sylphs, it has made me rather obsessed with the concepts of nation and culture, and how they relate to one another.\nI think I have made a rather poor start in my studies. Allow me to apologize for my behavior. I do not realize how difficult this has been for you.\nIn any case, thank you for lending me your time. I hope I can reward you in some fashion. Till then, Forename."]

Title: A Breath of Respite
Dialogue: ['\nCibleroit:', "\nGood evening, Forename. I'm glad to see you returned.\nYou are returned! To what do I owe the pleasure of this unexpected reunion?\nWell, of course! To a man of Ishgard!\nYou see, in your absence, I had the honor of speaking with one of our most distinguished scholars. He was a man of incomparable expertise, whose insights were unequaled.\nHe was a man of deep thought, and it was during our long and fruitful discussion of the nature of existence─as well as the nature of man─that I began to formulate the most important part of my theory.\nIt is my theory that man is essentially a cog in a giant machine, the “Izaniah.”\nIt was during our discussion of this most fascinating of machines that I stumbled across the oft-cited passage from Haldrath's Ultimatum.\nAccording to this passage, the Ixal use their flesh-and-blood hosts to power their magicks.\nIt is my theory that this method of transmission, known as magick, was employed by the Ixal to power their avatar.\nIt was this discovery that led me to explore new possibilities in my research. I began to see the connection between man and machine, and between man and his elemental vessel.\nAnd it was this discovery that inspired me to pen the most important of my articles: the one that would pave the road to my ultimate theory!\nThough I would eventually publish my articles under a different title, the title of my most important one─the one that would bring me great renown─is still my most important work to date!\nBut enough about me. I would have you take this upon yourself to read. The words I have given you are for your benefit.\nThe first and foremost duty of every Ishgardian is to protect the forest she calls home. This duty requires them both on and off duty, and it is for no other purpose would I place this burden upon you.\nNow go─beyond the forest, and into the heart of the beastman. Read what I have to give you.\nI will wait for you there.", '\nPopmessage:', '\nYou are under attack!', '\nAccess:', '\nThe enemy is still about!', '\nCibleroit:', "\nSo you have read my most important work. I trust you are eager to hear the rest.\nOh my, this is truly fascinating stuff! You have a true understanding of both man and his machine, and yet you do not see these things as separate entities?\nThe Ixal, it seems, see the two as inseparable.\nMan is an instrument of destruction, and the Ixal─at least in part─are a vessel for his emotions.\nThis is of course in contrast to our beloved forest, which they deem to be a vessel for his thoughts.\nIt is my theory that this difference between the two is what gives the Ixal their individuality.\nI am convinced that this must be so, and that it is through this difference that man and Ixal differ.\nFor instance, how do you think the Ixal view the concept of “self?”\nYou say they view it as an essential quality?\nThis is most fascinating indeed. If true, it would mean that the concept of self is not unique to man─and that it is innate in both the Ixal and our beloved forest.\nI must redouble my efforts to prove this. Here─take this as payment for your time."]

Dialogue: ['\nDadanen:', "Forename! I've had a dream...a vision. A dream of healing, of hope, and of courage. A dream of protecting the people of Eorzea from the darkness that threatens to engulf the Light. A dream that has reached its crescendo in the Calamity. And it is my hope that the people of Eorzea will one day wake up to this hope, and join our fight for liberation. But first, we must heal the wounds left by the Calamity. I have spent the last three years researching the true nature of the Echo. I learned that the Final Days were not a mere cycle of death and rebirth, but an age of untold peace and harmony. The peace that was shattered by the great wyrm, and the harmony that was restored by the heroes of Azys Lla. It was my hope that, with the aid of the three great kings─Hrothgar, Hraesvelgr, and Gordias─the ruins of the Final Days can be reclaimed. I have striven to bring peace back to this land, and to do so, I must needs understand the true nature of the Echo. But I am not alone. A great many of the people of Eorzea have also suffered unimaginable suffering, and for the past three years, I have done all I can to understand their pain. But the pain is too great for any one person to bear alone. I was born with a frail body, and was always nourished by the love of my mother and father. But the Calamity changed all that. I was no longer fit to bear the weight of my grief, and I began to suffer from a loss of muscle tone and strength. But I have always been more than a body, Dadanen. I have always been a warrior. It is for this reason─as a son of the great Hraesvelgr─that I have always wanted to be a hero. It is for no other reason that I have decided to dedicate my life to the Resistance. I will do all I can to see that the dreams of peace are realized, and to that end, I have set out on a journey to learn more of the Final Days. I am sure you are eager to hear more, Forename.
