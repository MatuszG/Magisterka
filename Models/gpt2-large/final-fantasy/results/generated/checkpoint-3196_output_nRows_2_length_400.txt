Title: A Beeautiful Plan
Dialogue: ['\nBroomc:', '\nWell met, adventurer! I serve as treasurer of the Adventurers' Guild here in Costa del Sol, and I am charged with keeping track of the members' spending.\nIt would be a simple task to budget our members' spending, but I fear I have no such skill.\nTherefore, I would have you assist me in compiling a comprehensive report of our members' finances.\nPlease bring me the budget for the next three moons─that is, the amount we must budget to ensure the guild is able to pay our bills.\nPlease do note that I am requesting a sum equal to the current value of the guild's stock in the Faeit Trading Company.\nPlease bring me this budget and please make sure it is approved before you continue.', '\nBroomc:', '\nPlease bring me the budget for the next three moons. It should be equal to the current value of the guild's stock in the Faeit Trading Company.', '\nBroomc:', '\nYes, this is precisely what we need! With your help, we will soon be able to cover our members' outstanding bills!\n<sigh> As treasurer, I am charged with keeping the good word of the guild strong. It is a responsibility which weighs heavily on my heart, as it should.\nYet I cannot bear to see the hardworking men and women of the guild suffer because of a few hasty decisions.\nSo long as I have this budget, I know that I can continue to do my part to support the guild.\nI thank you once again for your assistance. I hope the contents of this budget will prove to be of assistance to you as well.']

Dialogue: ['\nHabitat:', '\nIf you are up to the task, I would have you search for a species of bug that has recently infested the ruins south of here.\nThe bugs are so inconsiderate as to build their hives near the water, even though they are obviously ill at ease.\nThey should be exterminated, but I am not overly concerned with their immediate future. If they spread their poison to any more of my work, I will be bankrupt before you know it.\nAs you search, I suggest you search near the water. If you locate any bugs, kill them. I will make a killing from them, and in so doing will hopefully put an end to their existence.', '\nHabitat:', '\nYou should search near the water. If you locate any bugs, kill them.

Dialogue: ['\nFaucertaux:', "\nI'm in the midst of preparing a report for presentation to our council, but I can't seem to find the time to do any more research.\nWhat if, instead of asking the people of Costa del Sol what they know of the gods, we asked them to tell us what they know of the sylphs?\nIf you could go to the sylphs' village and ask for their knowledge of the gods─as I've asked─I would be in your debt.", '\nGullinkambi:', '\nYes\nNo', '\nGullinkambi:', '\nYes\nNo', '\nFaucertaux:', "\nDid you find out what the sylphs know?\nWonderful! It's a fascinating topic, you know.\nWe haven't had much interaction with the sylphs of late, but as a Costa del Sol citizen, I feel obligated to learn more.\nCosta del Sol isn't known for its rich natural resources, but knowledge of the gods could prove to be a valuable asset in the fight against the sin eaters.\nThis knowledge could be used to lure out the sylphs, allowing us to take them out without risk. Costa del Sol is in a constant state of needing new residents, and asking the people of Costa del Sol what they know of the gods could be a great help in filling the void.\nI hope our new residents enjoy learning about the sylphs and their gods. I look forward to hearing of their discoveries!"]
