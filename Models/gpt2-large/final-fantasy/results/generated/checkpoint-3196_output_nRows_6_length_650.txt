I could not continue it any further.\nTo make ends meet, I sold off my interest in the catalyst to a merchant named Rolfe. He is now in charge of collecting payments from the farmers who used to make their living from the catalyst.\nI am still unable to repay the debt I owe to my father.

Dialogue: ['\nTataru:', "\nSo, Forename. I trust you're well. I was hoping you might stop by for a quick bite to eat.\nI just heard word from our scouts. They've sent word that the Gnath are moving into Coerthas. \nThe Gnath are a ruthless and cunning species. They are like to take our forces unawares and overwhelm us.\nThe Gnath's incursions into our territory grow more daring by the day.

Did the Gnath pose any threat to you?\nI see. Well done, Forename. You managed to drive the Gnath from their lair with such ease.\nWe've made steady progress in our battle against the Gnath, but they are always finding new ways to circumvent our defenses.\nI fear the coming of the Children will further diminish our numbers. With their help, they will surely outnumber us in the years to come.\nBut we cannot waver now simply because we do not have enough men. We must strike first and foremost to defend against the Gnath.\nThe Gnath must be driven from our lands if we are to preserve the peace. I pray you continue to fight as you have done, and continue to defend the people of Twine."]
