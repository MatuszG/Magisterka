From its teachings you will be able to draw your own conclusions.\nThe atma is an extremely influential figure in Ishgard. It is not difficult to see why they would deem it so important that you should learn its secrets. It is for this reason that I have written this message into your instrument.

Indeed, it is what makes our world work.\nBut what Master Garlond spoke of goes far beyond the bounds of our physical being. Indeed, it is by looking beyond the limits of our physical being that we can begin to understand the bond between man and elemental, and how such knowledge may be applied to our benefit.\nFor example, mayhap you have heard of
