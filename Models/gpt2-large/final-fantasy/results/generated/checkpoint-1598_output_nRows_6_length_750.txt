Dialogue: ['\nTyrann:', "\nThis is your first time working with a relic, yes? Well then, I have an idea for you.\nThere is a very special tool known as a “grand harp.” The name itself suggests a wondrous, intangible quality, but I assure you it's as useful as any hammer.\nNow, it is no secret that we have struggled to find suitable replacements for the cores we lost in the Calamity─as you can see, the task has proven a rather vexing one.\nIt's not that we're short of resources─rather, the number of cores we have to replace has been limited by the nature of the materials we use, which we believe to be of a lower grade than was originally intended.\nYou will, however, be able to acquire a suitable number of cores from the other side of the wall.\nWe require a special kind of gemstone, which we have been asked to procure from a nearby cave.\nWe cannot obtain gemstones from the Twelveswood, which is why we have decided to seek out an area with a similar flora and fauna to the one we currently inhabit.\nI know you are eager to begin your search, but I would suggest you take a moment to rest.\nThe cave you seek is to the west of here. You should find it relatively easily, as I am certain you will have noticed the recent activity.\nOnce you are ready, meet me back here.", '\nTyrann:', '\nPlease, take as many cores as you can carry. I can't imagine you will be back in one piece, but I hope you enjoy the experience.', '\nTyrann:', '\nYou have returned! And not a moment too soon!\nMy apologies for placing such a burden on you. I have been overwhelmed by the amount of information I have received about the rebuilding effort.\nWe are at a critical juncture, and I do not believe it prudent to rush into any decision-making.\nI have also heard that you are eager to begin your search for suitable gemstones. I have no doubt you will find them useful, but I have no doubt you will also be disappointed if you do not find them at the end.']
