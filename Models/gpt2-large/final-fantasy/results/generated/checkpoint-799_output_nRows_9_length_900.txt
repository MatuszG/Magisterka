Title: A Brief Reprieve
Dialogue: ['\nSeverian:', "You have my thanks for your help. I had hoped that my efforts might bring you some respite from your fatigue.\nI knew, of course, that there was no other way to accomplish this.\nYet, I was in search of a means of obtaining the crystal, and as luck would have it, the Holy See had already procured a batch of crystals from the ruins of the Holy Fort.\nThe crystals, however, were not to be found in the ruins. Rather, they were found in a cave in the vicinity of the ruins, which was apparently discovered by adventurers.\nI had a feeling that I would find the crystals, but I was certain that the Holy See would not accept any of the crystals.\nSo I decided to ask the adventurer who discovered them to take them to me. I knew that he was a scholar, and if he would take the crystals, I could be certain that they would be given to me.\nAs it turns out, however, he was not in fact an adventurer, but a scholar.\nThe adventurer, however, could not help but be wary of the crystals. He asked if they were to be given to him, but he did not hesitate to say no.\nSo I took them to Severian himself, who was in the vicinity of the ruins. The crystal crystals he took to me were the ones he had previously received from the Holy See, and as luck would have it, he had already procured a batch of crystals from the Holy Fort.\nThe crystals, however, were not to be found in the ruins.
