Dialogue: ['\nMogret:', "I was about to head back to Poieten Oikos, but I've decided to stay a while and see how things are going there. If you find yourself wanting to head back, I suggest you make use of the bell on your map─you'll find the ferry to the southwest of the station.", '\nMogret:', "The ferry there is just over there.

I'd like to talk with the other boys in the village before we part ways.\nThe last place you want to be is on the northern end of the pier. There are more dangerous beasts lurking there than you might think.", '\nMogret:', "That was certainly fast. The captain said he'd be along shortly. Come, let's head back to the village.", '\nMogret:', "I'm glad you were able to talk to the others. They all seemed to think you were a friend.", '\nMogret:', "That's certainly good to hear. You were all kind and helpful in our time together.\nI'm sure the others will want to thank you for your help. I'll make sure to tell them.", '\nMogret:', "You're welcome to stay for as long as you like. Here, take this as a token of my thanks."]
