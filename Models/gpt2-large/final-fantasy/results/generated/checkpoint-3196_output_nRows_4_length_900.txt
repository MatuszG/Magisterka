We know little and less about its nature, and where it might be found.\nIt is for this reason that we have decided to focus our research on a new method of extracting the catalytic agent. We call it the “biomass” method.\nWe are confident that our discovery will revolutionize the extraction industry, not only because of the unprecedented amount of information it will produce, but also because it will eliminate the need for ever more cumbersome methods.\nWe are currently in the midst of finalizing the design for this new method, and hope to have it ready by the end of this year.\nI do hope you are able to continue your research at our side, Forename.

Of course, you need not be a trained warrior to try your hand at this challenge.\nYou need merely approach the ironborn lute in battle and strike it with your ironborn lance.

While you were fighting the lute, I asked if you would bring me one of its cores.\nIf I remember my culture studies correctly, you are expected to procure cores from fallen beasts. Do you know what I mean?\nThe “core” is the central core of the lute. It is said to contain the soul of the lute itself.\nI would like you to retrieve this core and then return to me.

I make all manner of instruments, but I'm especially fond of brass instruments.\nYou see, I was once a student of the fine arts at Ul'dah's prestigious Lyceum. I made my living making brass instruments, but things took a turn for the worse when I discovered that I couldn't make enough of them. I was forced to turn to the black market.\nAfter a while, I began to wonder: what if I made my own brass instruments, but at a much lower price? I decided to put my idea to the test. I set out to purchase a single brass instrument, and ended up spending more on it than I could afford on a whole range of other items.\nThe only issue is, I've no idea where to start. Do you think you could search for one in my place?\nIf you do, be sure to do it with my horns. I can't be arsed to go searching for them myself.

I bought it from an Ul'dahn merchant a while ago. It's a pity it's not as pretty as I'd like, but it serves its purpose.\nIt's just a pity that most folk don't know that. All the brass instruments I make are hand-forged, and I don't feel comfortable making them so that everyone can see how much I've gone through to make them.\nThat's why I wanted you to bring this one. I'm sure you'll find that most folk will find it most useful.\nYou can take it to Gerolt, over in Sweetsieve. I'm sure he'd be pleased to see it.", '\nGerolt:', "\nAye, I heard from Fyrilsunn. Seems she's put a brass instrument in my hands again.\nThe Ul'dahn lass is a shrewd one, to say the least. She knows how to get her hands on the best brass instruments, and this time she ain't buying them from Ul'dah at all. She's after my brass instrument back, that's what she's after.\nI don't know what she's after, but I sure as hell want my brass instrument back. Anyroad, I'm off to Sweetsieve to pick up my instrument. Be sure to pass my horn to Fyrilsunn when you get there.", '\nFyrilsunn:', "\nIf you're looking for my brass instrument, it's in Sweetsieve. Just go through the gate in the distance and you'll see it.", '\nFyrilsunn:', "\nOh my, you're back! And with my horn? Fantastic! This is everything I hoped for!\nI knew I was right to count on you, boy. With my skills, it'd be a shame not to make something of this world.\nI'll put the finishing touches on my new instrument when I've finished hammering out the old one.

That you witnessed his triumph in the flesh, and that it was by your hand that he came to deliver the All.\nThat would surely please the younglings, and so I imagine you'd be willing to bear that truth for them.\nNow, the truth is, I was there. I saw the battle for Yedlihmad. I was there with the Warrior of Light, when the Mother of the All was slain.\nI was not wounded by the dragons, nor did I receive any grievous wounds. But I did witness the devastation─as did many others.\nYou see, even though we Ishgardians pride ourselves on seeing to our own defenses, the devastation caused by the dragons was so great that we were forced to take extraordinary measures to protect our citizens. Measures that put the lives of our knights and our children in great danger.\nWe fortified the walls with the most heavily fortified bastion in all of Ishgard─the Crystal Tower. Yet somehow, the dragons managed to breach it.\nWe deployed magitek armor to repel them, but it proved no match for the dragons' powerful magicks.\nUltimately, they triumphed, and the Mother of the All was sealed within the tower.\nThe younglings were taught to revere the heroes of yore, and to emulate their greatness. But as you can see, the path to herohood is not an easy one─especially when the path lies in the shadow of tragedy.\nSo I must ask you this─if you're willing to tell the truth, would you do so in my stead? It would mean a great deal to the younglings.\nTell them that they must someday strive to be like their hero, that they must someday strive to be like the Mother of the All.
