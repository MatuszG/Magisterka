It looked like some sort of magitek weaponry, and I couldn't help but wonder what it might be used for...\nWhen I finally got my hands on it, it was all but broken. But that's when I realized the crate wasn't just broken─it was entirely gone!\nAnd with that, the entire thing had been jettisoned into the depths of the earth.

Break this crystal and bring it to Taynor. He'll repair the broken parts of the weapon and reassemble it.\nI'd hoped that by recovering this crystal, I might at last be able to recreate the weapon. Alas, that hope is now dashed, for the weapon is no more.\nBut that's not all─I've also discovered something else of interest in the depths of the earth.\nThis is an ancient text of some sort, likely containing some sort of arcane incantation. It's hard to make out what it says, but I'm fairly confident I know what it means.\nWith this, I believe I can read the words, and decipher the incantation.\nIf I can somehow read the words, I'm sure Taynor can read them, too.\nI need your help to decipher the words─and before I forget, I'd like you to bring me the crystal I found.\nYou'll find the crystal in the depths of the earth, in the crate that was jettisoned.

Well, I suppose I shouldn't be the one to ask.\nYou've learned a valuable lesson today─don't be so greedy as to break the rules.\nGood luck in your hunt, friend. I hope you'll come back to see me again."]

I hope this doesn't mean too much, but I'm sure you're curious to know more.\nThe Aetherotransformer is an entirely new type of mechanical life-form─itself a fusion of Aetherotransformer technology and ancient magitek weaponry. Created as an energy source for the Gridanian aetheric reactor, it was conceived as a means of augmenting existing weaponry.\nIts primary purpose, however, is to power the aetherotransformer's processing node, which in turn powers the Gridanian aetheric reactor.\nIn exchange for this power, the aetherotransformer has been designed to carry out a variety of tasks─such as ingesting aetherial energy from the environment and purifying it using a unique membrane.\nThough it is a rather complex system, its functionality is undeniable. Indeed, the more we develop our capabilities, the more we realize the potential of this new kind of life-form.\nAnd so we are working to perfect our newest creation─the Aetherotransformer, and we would be remiss to do so without taking the time to explain its myriad capabilities.\nBut I believe I have explained everything you need to know.

Dialogue: ['\nZlatan:', '\nWhile we are pleased to see the Maelstrom has come to our aid, we are also mindful to not draw attention to our contributions.\nThat is why we have prepared a single-use decoy for you to carry to the front lines.\nShould you succeed in delivering it to a comrade in need, we will see to it they receive all the treatment they need.', '\nZlatan:', "\nIt should be noted that this decoy is bound for the front lines, and thus poses a threat to any enemy combatants.

Dialogue: ['\nGildon:', '\nI hope this is all that awaits.\nYou see, I was fortunate to receive a letter just now from the captain of the guard at the airship landing.\nIt begins, “A brief reprieve has been granted for the recently departed, but they must be prepared for a prolonged stay.”\nWith no other suitable options available, I was pleased to see that the captain considered me to be a capable replacement.\nI shall make ready for the long haul, but I would ask that you keep an eye on the weather.\nI trust that the winds will hold steady for the time being, and that the skies will remain clear for the time being.
