Dialogue: ['\nAlphinaud:', '\nI have the honor of being the first to congratulate you on the most important victory in our nation's history!\nI am certain you are eager to hear about the battle, and I have no doubt you will be.\nThe battle was fought in the forests south of here. In order to achieve victory, we had to slay an enormous number of the creatures.\nThe forest has always been a vital part of the Horde's strategy, and it was a battle to which the Horde was unaccustomed.\nThey were able to overwhelm us with their numbers, but I fear we have yet to realize the full value of the forest.\nIt is my hope that the forest's value may be enhanced in your absence.\nOur enemies will be drawn to the forest's abundance of wild mushrooms, and I would ask you to hunt them down, so that we may have more mushrooms to feed upon.\nI would ask you to hunt wild mushrooms in the forests south of here. We cannot afford to lose another forest!']
