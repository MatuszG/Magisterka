Is there something you require?\nAh, the fatted calf! Wrenric had it made for you. You may be a worldly gentleman, but your heart's in the right place, my friend!\nA sacrifice of this quality is worth a great deal of coin. I'll not have Rowena having to foot the bill.\nSo, what do you say? Will you be getting your money's worth from this masked man of yours?\nNot a chance! I wouldn't dream of assisting a stranger who I'm not even sure is genuine.\nBut if there's anyone who can bring me a piece of art worth a fortune, it'd be Wrenric, my friend! And you can trust she'll set you rightwise!", '\nWrenric:', "Hurry, else I'm like to die of shame!\nThis fatted calf is no more! Rowena will not have to foot the bill, you can be sure of that.\nThis masked man was a master of disguise. A master we've lost, if you ask me.\nYet in the eyes of the masses, he was treated as a myth, a legend made of lies and steel. In his mind, he was the Dark Lord, the savior of Gridania.\nBut to his friends, he was simply a good man who happened to share the same name. And to me, he was a friend at heart, one who wanted very much to help me fulfill my dream of painting images of glory onto the walls of the realm.\nHe died a noble death, and in the telling of it, he was seen as a sort of paragon, equal to the great heroes of yore.\nYes, I suppose that's what happened. In a way, I suppose that's what he wanted...\nTo tell the truth, when I first agreed to help you, I had no inkling that you might be capable of such deeds.\nBut you've proven yourself far more than a mere pawn in my master's schemes. I've no doubt you're now capable of more than simple altruism.\nYou've brought me my calf, and in exchange, you've given me my hopes for the future. I can't thank you enough, my friend!"]

Title: A Bargain Struck
Dialogue: ['\nGildon:', "I've been following the negotiations with the Resistance and I've been impressed with both their persistence and cunning. I do wish they would agree to lay down their arms─but they won't.\nYou see, the Garleans want all of southern Thanalan under their heel, and if we don't give them what they want, they will send troops to take our homes.\nAnd since we've shown such a willingness to stand against them, they've no choice but to believe we can be bought.\nThat's why they've struck a deal with the Resistance, offering generous compensation for any soldier who agrees to lay down their arms─which is more than I can say for any of my countrymen.\nThat's why I've been standing against them, and I'm not going to sit by and see it happen.\nI've drafted a letter to explain the situation and I'd be grateful if you could deliver it to Commander Rhiki at the Ruby Price.", '\nRhihim:', "You've come at a good time, Commander.\nI've been expecting you. The negotiations are still ongoing, but I've been given authorization to enter Castrum Abania.\nAs for the soldier who agreed to lay down his arms─I've been given leave to escort him to the capital.\nIf you would like to join me, pray speak with Commander Rhiki at the Ruby Price.", '\nRhihim:', 'I would like very much to accompany the soldier to Castrum Abania, but I must refuse the offer of escort.\nI must decline.\nA soldier who consents to accompany me is a valuable asset for the Resistance, and I cannot allow him to be used as bait to lure our enemy into making a deal.\nI will remain here and continue my negotiations. If you should have a change of heart, you may call on me at any time.', '\nCommander Rhiki:', "Welcome back, Commander. I take it you've spoken with the soldier who consented to accompany you.\n...He said he came here on a reconnaissance mission and has no ties to the Resistance. That's all I was able to tell you.\nIn any case, I understand his decision. He did what he had to do to protect us.\nBut we can't have soldiers arming the Resistance with weapons they might use to commit war crimes.\nI've drafted a letter to explain the situation and I'd be grateful if you could deliver it to Commander Rhiki at the Ruby Price.", '\nRhihim:', 'Pray speak with Commander Rhiki at the Ruby Price.
