We would go out and hunt beasts until we had killed enough to feed our families for the day.\nAfter the Garleans invaded, the tribes fought side by side to purge the monstrosities. But as time passed and the Horde expanded, the number of tribes increased and conflict grew.\nToday, we number just over a dozen tribes, but we are a proud people who fight hard for what we have.\nWhen you speak with our men, they will tell you that we live to fight. They will tell you that we are not easily satisfied with our lot.\nBut you will find that most of our men are content with their lot. They are hardworking men who love hunting and fishing and being with their families.\nThis makes us a proud people, I should think. But for someone who has never known war, it can be hard to know where to stand.\nThat is why I wanted you to have this. You will see that our men are proud men, men who fight for what they have. You will see that they care deeply for their lives and the lives of their families.\nI hope that you will use this knowledge to bring peace back to our lands and that you will be a friend to our people for many years to come.']

Desperate to atone for his disobedience, he begged Nu Mou to give him this lyre.\nBut Nu Mou refused, knowing that such a fine instrument could only be obtained through mortal sacrifice. And so he remained in hiding, away from prying eyes.\nFor a long time, he would only play the lyre in secret, away from prying eyes. But one day, he decided to share the instrument with others, in the hope that others would atone for their sins.\nHe recruited three mortal lovers to play the lyre to his fellow gods. And with their help, he reached the holy water at the bottom of the well.\nAfterwards, he placed the instrument upon the altar at the center of Kholusia. And from then on, he continued to perform the puissant prayer to the gods.\nTo ensure that his prayer would reach its desired effect, he would often perform the same feat at different places around Kholusia.\nHowever, one day, he became so absorbed in his prayer that he completely lost track of time. While performing the puissant prayer, he lost track of his own time, and when he came to, he found that he had completely forgotten the song.\nWith no other recourse, he decided to end his own life. But before he could do so, he was discovered by a Nu Mou, and nursed back to health by his people.\nAfter recovering, he returned to perform the puissant prayer at the altar once more. This time, however, he chose to place the lyre upon the well.\nThough we know not why, it has become our custom to bow down before our mortal lovers when we offer our prayers to the gods.\nPerhaps, in our heart of hearts, we know that it is not enough. That we must atone for our sins, and atone for those of our comrades who have yet to die.\nToday, I would ask you to perform the puissant prayer at the altar once more.

A poem? A tale? I can only hope that my friend included both!\nIf only I could honor his memory by sharing with you his most prized possession, a book that contains a tale from his childhood.\nIn the days before the Calamity, my brother and I used to read The Warrior of Light by Eginolf.

I know that I would!\nI remember my brother telling me stories from his childhood, of heroes such as The Hero of Light.\nI wonder if my brother even remembers his own name, having been so changed by the Calamity.\nWould they ever recognize each other? I know that I would! They would be forever in my heart, and I would cherish them forever and ever!\nThat is why I wrote this book─so that someday, one day, they might be able to meet in person, and share a moment together...", '\nRedbrix:', "\nThe Warrior of Light? That's the one I wanted to see!\nI know he said he wanted to meet you, but hearing him say it in person...it sounded more like he wanted to hear you talk!\nI'll admit─I did not really expect you to go with him. I hoped to surprise him and give him a book, but it sounds like he wants to hear you read it, too.\nI would like you to give this to him. It's the only thing he really needs.\nPlease, go and meet him in front of the Inn. I will wait here until he finishes his work.\nI will wait here until he finishes his work.", '\nWanderingminstrel:', "\nSo you have met my friend, then. What did he have in store for you?\nA poem?

I hope you like it as much as I do.\nThank you for this book. I hope that my brother and sister will be able to share a moment together someday!"]

I cannot wait to get it home.\nI was so certain it would be there that I even called the Uyagir to ask them if they had seen it.\nBut they all said no, they said no one had seen it. And so I went on a hunt for it, but I was so sure I would find it... I was so sure.\nBut no matter how hard I tried, I could not find it.
