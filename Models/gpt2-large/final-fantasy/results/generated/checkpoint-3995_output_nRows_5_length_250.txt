Dialogue: ['\nBomott:', "\nThe word of the nunh is law. Those who turn a deaf ear to the nunh, they will no longer have ears.\nI've had to make a decision─to listen to the nunh or not.

Make the pilgrimage to Thal's Respite and listen to what the nunh has to say.", '\nBomott:', "\nThe nunh has spoken. The decision is yours.

Dialogue: ['\nTatafu:', "\nYou're Forename, aren't you? Aye, I knew from a glance what manner of man you were. I also knew from experience that you weren't afraid to make a bold decision.\nNow, what is it you require of me? While I am loath to impose, I have no choice. It is for this very reason that I have decided to entrust the leadership of our forces to a man of your ability.\nWith that in mind, I would have you lead our forces into battle. You need only grasp the situation at hand, so let us speak of your objective.\nYou wish to destroy the Garleans' weapons research facility, yes? That is a simple task, I should think.\nYou would accomplish this task without delay? Aye, it is a straightforward task. All you must do is locate the research facility and ensure that it is safe.\nWhile this is a straightforward task, I should think it through carefully. Should our forces find themselves in need of an additional source of fuel, for example, it is possible that a supplementary shipment of provisions may be sent. It

Dialogue: ['\nAlphinaud:', '\nI have not been idle in my time on this stage. I have been engaged in a most vital debate with my colleagues, the members of the Allagan Empire's Council of Ministers.\nIt is a matter of life and death. I could well end my career on the morrow if I were to be denied a hearing for my proposal.\nBut I fear that my colleagues would sooner give up and concede defeat than consent to a proposal they could so easily see to.\nI must prevail. If my appeal is not denied, I shall order the marshals to summon Admiral Merlwyb Bloefhiswyn at once!', '\nAlisaie:', "\nThe council has already agreed to send an envoy to Ul'dah. It would be no exaggeration to say that this is a done deal.", '\nMerlwyb:', "\nWelcome back, Forename. I take it Y'shtola and Tataru have been busy preparing for your arrival?\nGood.

Dialogue: ['\nAuphiliot:', '\nThe time has come to make a bold decision─to ally with the Resistance!\nI speak not of mere sentiment. We have reason to believe the Admiral is planning something. Something large. Something ominous.\nI would be lying if I said more information was not already available to me. What I can say is, I have been keeping my ears and eyes open─and I have not been alone.\nWord has it that the Far East is brimming with military men and women ready to serve. I would be a fool to refuse the offer of service─especially if it is to be to a Resistance unit!', '\nPop:', '\nYou sense a hostile presence!', '\nAuphiliot:', "\nAh, Forename─the familiar scent of your battle garb has faded. I trust you have heard the rumors.\nThe Admiral is said to be on the move─or at least that is what the reports have said. If the reports are true, he could be anywhere─even in Aleport!\nI would head for Aleport immediately─the sooner

I'm working for the Alliance army now, and it's about time I made the acquaintance of someone with experience in the field.\nCommander Falkbryda spoke highly of you when you first arrived. I've no doubt that you will make a fine soldier.\nAnd of course, I can think of no one more suited to the task.

Dialogue: ['\nUrianger:', '\nThe matter of the primals' primals is one of the most difficult and delicate matters the Order of the Twin Adder has ever dealt with.\nTo suggest even the slightest possibility of the existence of these entities is to invite dire consequences. Should they be identified, the very fabric of reality would be torn asunder, and all who stand in their way would be forever changed.\nThis is why the Grand Companies have so consistently and formally denied the existence of their kind. Even were they to be proven, however, I would be far too confident in my belief that they would be summarily dispatched.\nThe matter may be decided by the Alliance, but even should they choose to join us, I would be far more certain of my own defeat.', '\nAlphinaud:', '\nYour confidence is plain and plainer than I dared hope.

However, much to our dismay, they too were conquered by the Empire.\nThe ruins remain to this day, but only a handful of people have ever made the pilgrimage to visit them. Those who are able to make the journey are often rewarded with great riches!\nThe current situation however, makes it extremely difficult for them to procure such items. Thus, many seek other means to express their devotion, such as by undertaking dangerous and arduous journeys.\nI am loath to impose upon your generosity further, but would be most grateful if you could deliver these items to a local resident
