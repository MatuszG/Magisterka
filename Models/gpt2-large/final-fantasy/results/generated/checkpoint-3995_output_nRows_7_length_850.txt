Dialogue: ['\nMogret:', "My superior officer requested that I inspect the goods that I confiscated. As it turns out, these were smuggled from the Garleans themselves.\nIt's no small task to infiltrate an imperial army base and steal weapons and armor, but I'm not short on gallantry. I agreed to assist my superior in his inspection.\nIt was only a few days ago that we discovered the remains of several prisoners─guarding a prison that was recently constructed. Though it's not the first time─the Garleans have been known to construct their own concentration camps.\nIf this is indeed the case, we must do all in our power to prevent their reclamation. Forgive me for being a hopeless idealist, but I can think of no other way to serve my countrymen.\nI'll return to my post at once. Should you have any questions, pray speak with my commanding officer.", '\nMogret:', "Ah, you're back. After your inspection, did you find anything out of the ordinary?\n...Weapons from the Garleans themselves? That...is highly irregular.\nI would not be surprised to learn that the prisoners served in the imperial army. In fact, it would not surprise me in the slightest if these were officers who were conscripted by the Garleans.\nIf there is any truth to this, it would be a most opportune time to take back those imperial-issue weapons.\nBut all we can do is take it on the chin and cope as best we can. We cannot allow the tragedy that was the Calamity to go unanswered."]

Could you go and find a few of the dead bees for me?\nHere, take this vial of honey. I want you to sprinkle this around the dead bees. That should help get them out of their burrow.\nI can't thank you enough, friend! Hopefully the bees will come back to me in one piece.\nPanicked Man:", "Did you find all of the dead bees?\nYes, this is perfect! Thank you so much.\nI thought I'd never see my bees again.\nIf I keep traveling like this, one day I'll have enough money to buy a new suit.\nMaybe then I can be a beekeeper for good!"]

Soon after, both houses were driven to take up arms against their common enemy─the heretics.\nAfter the calamitous defeat at the hands of the heretics, Humes and Hildirn were forced to bend their knee, and the Holy See was founded.\nNeedless to say, the Holy See did not take an interest in the restoration of the former houses.\nNevertheless, the church's position has not changed─it is still under the sway of the noble houses, and they are required to observe the same rites and traditions.\nSo long as the Holy See continues to fulfill its role as the government of the Orthodox Church, the interests of the noble houses will be protected.\nYes, I believe I understand what your envoy said.

Should this practice continue, it is only a matter of time before the entire species is lost to the wilds.\nFor your part in bringing this issue to my attention, you have my thanks.\nNow, you may be wondering just why a Dravanian chocobo would be of interest to you. There is, of course, the matter of the mount itself.\nSimply put, a Dravanian chocobo is a type of mount that was developed by the Ishgardians for use in their Dravanian Dravanian War─a conflict that spanned decades and claimed the lives of countless Dravanians.\nUpon learning that the beast you seek had been sighted in Eorzea, you are doubtless eager to take up the challenge.\nGiven the relative ease with which you have obtained a chocobo, I would not be surprised to hear that you are considering making the journey yourself.\nGiven the opportunity, would you not also consider joining us in the hunt for the extinction of the white-furred beast? I should hope that you would consider joining us sooner rather than later, given the considerable amount of gil you would save by joining us.", '\nPulshsooan:', "Master Garlond is sure to be receptive to your request.

Your ability to discern the significance of small details, to see the connections between seemingly unrelated events, is truly something to behold.\nI would not doubt that you will one day be called upon to fill a leadership role in Althyk.\nIn the meantime, please feel free to visit the Archers' Guild and continue your training."]

It has been a long road, but thanks to you, the name of one of our new allies has been raised again.\nThe Maelstrom has long been the proud home of those who defend the Crystarium. Your brethren there fought bravely at the Naadam, and it is with pride that we retell their tale in song.\nHowever, in recent days, word has reached me that some here seek to turn those battles into spectacles, to entertain the masses with raucous renditions of our nation's history.\nThe Naadam is a time-honored rite of passage for our knights, but those who would make the stage have no right to turn it into a spectacle.\nIt is not only our code of conduct that forbids such conduct─it is also the law.\nIt has come to my attention that some here intend to perform the song in the manner you see fit. It would be neither kind nor proper to allow such a display to go unchallenged.\nIt has been decided: no knight who faces his enemy will raise his sword to strike down his foe.\nThus, Kenn Gyuf shall not be the site of your spectacle. Nor shall any knight who so much as looks upon you suffer the whims of the crowd.\nIf the meaning of your coming to Lad Kenn is to be conveyed to the people of Ishgard, you will need to prove yourself worthy of a place alongside them.

But such is the nature of our nation's government.\nThe House of Commons has no power to pass such a measure, and the Empire has no power to reject it.\nBut if the House of Commons is to be believed, and I have no reason to doubt them, the Resistance will not only join the war against the will of the House of Commons, but will fight with the House of Commons against the Empire.\nI should hope that the House of Commons will not consider this an acceptable state of things─that we should bend the knee to the Empire on every matter. But history teaches us that is not always the case.\nI must say, I was rather impressed with your display of strength this day. It would not surprise me should you one day take command of the Resistance.\nAt any rate, I would appreciate it if you could inform the House of Commons that preparations for the Resistance's entry into the war against the Empire are underway.\nI will see that the Resistance is given the necessary support as they begin their preparations.\nI will also see to it that any uniforms bearing the House's crest are returned to their rightful owner.\nThank you for your service, sir. I will not hold it against you should you continue to serve the House of Commons."]
