A man who persevered to the bitter end, blazing trails and scattering bombs until he had struck his mark. You are a man who lives for others. And that ideal is the pursuit of true mastery. You should know, in pursuit of it, you have faced hardship and pain, both physical and mental. Yet through it all, you have ever persevered, and persevered bigly.\nBut it is not enough for a man to achieve mastery. He must also live with his ideal in mind, and make it his life's work. A true craftsman must never be content with his craft's mere existence. He must strive day and night, week and month, to improve it. Only through such constant and unceasing effort can he be called a true craftsman. A true craftsman must never be content with his craft's mere existence. He must strive day and night, week and month, to improve it. Only through such constant and unceasing effort can he be called a true craftsman.\nYou understand, do you? You are what I have long sought. A craftsman who can satisfy both his physical and mental needs, and yet more importantly, one who does not settle for less than his ideal. A man who is ever searching, ever searching, for that which he desires. A man who is a man of purpose, and who lives for others. A true craftsman must never be content

I imagine that's something our allies will want to hear.\nSpeaking of whom, let's see if we can't talk about the hero before we head to Ishgard.\nBefore we get to that, though, there is something I would like to discuss.\nI was born and raised in Ishgard, but my family has always left the city. As a youngling, I dreamed of moving away and joining the fight against the sin eaters.\nBut as the war dragged on, it became increasingly difficult to travel, and I eventually wound up living out of a tent for the longest time. I was constantly searching for places to fight, and eventually found myself wandering the plains.\nIn the time it took me to finish telling this story, a friend of mine came across a relic blade engraved with a lily motif. He asked me if I would take it to him in Ishgard, and I did.\nI knew then that the blade would bring me back to Ishgard, and I decided to keep it. I've been here ever since, and I've become more and more fond of the place.\nOf course, not everything in my past is a memory. Sometimes, it's just not possible to live here. I know that feeling well.\nBut I know that somewhere, somehow, I've always known that place. And I will always remember my friend and his

They said it'd be better if I trained somewhere else.\nThe problem is, the place I wanted to train is directly across the way from the camp.\nThe monsters are so huge I can't train anywhere near them, and even if I could, I wouldn't be able to fight them.\nIf you were to go in my place, it would be a much safer bet. You'll be able to fight off the beasts, and hopefully even attract a new recruit to the Crystarium!\nI'll pay you for your troubles, but I insist you first find the monster you chased down. It's probably somewhere to the north.", '\nCaitlyn:', "\nYou're back! Did you find the monster I asked for?\nThank goodness. It sounds like he was quite the fierce one, even by Crystarium standards.\nI was worried he would attack me, but I'm glad he wasn't able to. I've been so focused on training, I completely lost track of time.\nI can't imagine what would have happened had he attacked me. I was born and raised here, so I know it's never going to get better, but I know I'll be okay, somehow.\nThat's what training is all about─making you a better you. That's why I wanted you to train, to get me ready to face whatever comes up.\nI'm glad I was able to help you today, and thanks to you, I was able to rediscover the joy of training.\nIf you want to keep training, you'll have to pay me something. I promised you a reward, so here it is!"]
