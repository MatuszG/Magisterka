Ever since the Maelstrom rose to power, they have been pitted against one another in a never-ending struggle.\nBut to view the matter as merely one of race relations is to deny the reality of the situation. The existence of the Garleans and the Empire is not something that is merely disputed─the reality is that it is now at war.\nShould the Empire collapse, or be removed from our lands at the hands of our allies, then our cause will have been achieved.\nI cannot help but fear that, should the opportunity to forge a peaceful resolution to the conflict presents itself, we may be drawn into a conflict we could not win. But I see that there is no reason to fear such a fate.\nI think it clear that the peoples of the Steppe are one and the same, and I cannot help but wonder what path the resolution might tread.
