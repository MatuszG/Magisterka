Title: A Beeautiful Plan
Dialogue: ['\nMussalfret:', '\nYou, adventurer, are a man who likes to think. A man who likes to plan.\nBut I fear you are not a man to make plans. You are a man who likes to fight. A man who likes to kill.\nThat is why I ask that you do not aid me in my hunt.\nInstead, you should seek out the beasts I have set loose in the fields north of here.\nAs for you, Forename─will you go and slay them for me? If you will, you will be rewarded for your trouble.', '\nMussalfret:', '\nThe beasts I have set loose in the fields north of here are to the north of here.

I'm afraid I can't talk about it here.\nI imagine House Durendaire is in great distress. This is a message that House Durendaire would very much like to hear.\nPlease hurry and deliver it to them.

Dialogue: ['\nCedric:', "\nI trust you were not surprised to learn that the dragons have fallen prey to our efforts?\nNo, of course not.

Let us hurry to the hive and see what we can find.\nI must warn you, however, that this area is fraught with danger. Be sure to take care when leaving the hive.", '\nCedric:', '\nI shall see to it that your preparations are complete.']
