Title: A Blessed Instrument
Dialogue: ['\nTataru:', "\nThis...this is a gift from my parents. It's a piece of my heart, if you can believe it.\nMy parents always told me that the best way to express gratitude was to give something back to the world.\nAnd the best way to do that, they said, was to give something back to the people who live here.\nI was so determined to help that I even worked at the same place I did when I was young─a little shop called the Blacksmith's Guild.\nAnd then one day, I got so caught up in my work that I forgot to give it back to the people.\nThat was when I decided to make this a gift and I have been carrying it ever since.\nI thought it would be a simple thing, but it turns out that it's a lot more than that.\nFor one, it's a piece of history. It's the story of a girl who helped bring peace between the two peoples.\nIt's a story that has been passed down through generations, and it's a story that I hope you will remember.\nIt also tells us a little about you. In the old days, you used to be called a tanuki, a name that means you're a hard worker.\nNow, you can't say that anymore. You've become a tanuki.\nThe people of the city are all tanuki.\nThey tell me that you're one of them, so you must be the one who brought peace between the two peoples.\nI think I'm going to have to make you my gift.\nYou don't think it will be a simple thing, do you? That's fine. It's not about how much you can give, it's about giving back.\nYou'll have to give me back my heart, though. I'll have to find a way to express that gratitude in something. I hope you give it back to me as soon as you have a bit of time to spare."]
