It goes without saying that the harp must sound beautiful.\nSound is one thing that an instrument must have, and if the harp's sound is to be of the utmost worth─as well as that of its maker─then it is essential that the instrument have a certain quality.\nIn my opinion, the harpist's task is best served by learning how to hear the notes that make up a song. Songs are composed of a number of small, distinct notes that must be heard to the best of one's ability.\nIn order to do so, one must listen to music both familiar and unfamiliar. One might start by listening to a selection of Beethoven's Seventh Symphony or a rendition of the Rhapsody of the Night.\nIn the case of the latter, I suggest practicing while standing in a place that has been designated a “nightingale's lap.”
