If you would go and investigate the area, I would be ever so grateful.\nSpeak with my subordinate, Severian. He will tell you more.\nGo to the Senaculum and look for an unusual creature.

I had been hoping you might return.\nYou see, these Garlean bezoars were said to be borne by a Garlean magitek.\nHowever, as we've discovered, they have a habit of devouring anything that comes within their sight.\nAs a result, we have had to come up with a way to keep them away. We've been developing a new kind of grenade, the bismarck, which is infused with poison as a defense mechanism.\nThe idea was that if a bezoar came near our soldiers, they would automatically become imbued with poison as well, preventing them from being killed.\nUnfortunately, we haven't had much luck testing the new grenade out in the field.\nBut as you can see, we are quite close to being able to keep the bezoars away from our soldiers.\nWe are still a long way off, but I'm confident that we will succeed.\nIf all goes according to our plan, we should be able to eliminate the entire bezoar population in a matter of days.\nThank you again for your help. I hope to one day be able to repay your kindness."]

It is not often we find such a gifted individual in the same room as us.\nIt is only through such intimate knowledge of the instrument that we are able to improve so swiftly.\nLest you wonder, the task will be performed in the manner in which you have just witnessed. The lilies will be placed in a pot and placed on the stove.\nWhen the time comes for you to perform the final step of the training, pray do it in the way I instructed.

I speak of a man by the name of Regana, who did likewise for another gobbieflock in Gridania some time ago.\nThe two of them were to embark on a grand journey, to bring back the child of the gods─if the stories are to be believed.\nHowever, unbeknownst to them, their intended destination was...Gridania. And it is there that they met an untimely demise.\nIt is said that the young gobbieflock was taken by a marauding band of Garlean soldiers, who proceeded to bind, gag, and otherwise torture the child ere they could deliver him to their masters.\nWhile I cannot vouch for the veracity of these reports, I can say with certainty that the child has not yet been delivered.

They also employ a single, highly-placed agent to facilitate their efforts.\nNow, while we cannot be certain of the gobbieflock's identity, we can safely say that whatever it is responsible for, it is attempting to bring about the New Eorzean Order.\nAlas, the path to achieving this ends with the gobbieflock. He must be stopped before his plans can be realized.\nTo that end, we have established a new task force, the “Commander's Task Force.” Each member of this new unit is a seasoned veteran of the struggle against the imperials─an example to be followed by all of our citizens.\nWith their combined strength, we will dismantle the imperials' greatest weapon and ensure that the gobbieflock never arrives at his destination.\nI hope you'll join us, friend.

But never for something so trivial as joining a war effort.\nAnd gods forbid anyone else gets caught up in it.\nBut I suppose it doesn't matter. All that matters is that the recruit gets the message. He's ours now.\nHeh heh, I knew he'd be one of the bravest men in the Sultansworn. I just didn't know he'd be one so lacking in conviction.\nI know he means well, but this isn't about him. This is about you. This is about you getting out of your own way. This is about you proving to everyone that you're not afraid.\nYou'll find him at Camp Dragonhead. He'll be there, waiting for you. Remember that you owe him. And heh, I knew he'd be one of the bravest men in the Sultansworn.

You will likely face far fewer of them in your lifetime, however.\nThis is in part due to a change in our military tactics. Rather than attempting to overwhelm an opponent with a large number of attacks, we focus on small, precise blows.\nBy employing such techniques, we are able to make fast and decisive strikes.\nIt is a style of combat that I believe best suits you, Forename.\nNow, I would like you to demonstrate what you have learned.

But thanks to you, they won't be getting that way.\nTo give an idea of what it's like to live under sylphic rule, imagine it: the kobolds would have made Twine a lake of rats. Imagine it!', '\nGullinkambi:', "\nSo, did you manage to kill the sylphs?\nGood work! The sylphs are no more? Good work! We can finally return to Twine.\nBut I must say─it's a relief to finally be rid of those horrid sylphs. They were a nuisance, to be sure, but we couldn't handle a whole army on our own, could we?\nThat's why I'm glad you were here to help. Thanks to you, we were able to put the kobolds down quickly and quietly. It's thanks to your efforts that we were able to return safely to Twine."]
