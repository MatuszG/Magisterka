In doing so, they apparently bred and raised the beasts in their own image, and thus the line of beasts to which we refer today.\nIt is said that the Belah'dians built artificial structures within the gardens, and that they maintained them with their own hands. This method of population control is said to have been particularly effective in keeping the beasts in check.\nThough we have little firsthand knowledge of the subject, we have reason to believe that such a civilization could not only exist, but thrive, as well.\nI must ask you to retrieve a sample of bone from within the artificial structures for further study. I realize this may seem like a trivial matter, but as you are well aware, even a single sample of bone can tell us a great deal about a people, or a nation, or even a species.\nIt is, however, something of a mercy that you are not the one tasked with retrieving the bone─as you would surely have little difficulty in doing so yourself.\nI shall await your return.
