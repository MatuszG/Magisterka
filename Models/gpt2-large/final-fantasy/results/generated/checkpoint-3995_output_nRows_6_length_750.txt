Dialogue: ['\nVarthon:', "It was a bargain, was it not? I paid good coin for this fruit─but only to have it snatched away by those winged nightmares!\nI've had to bury too many achingly cold nights wondering if my lucky red roses would be next. I don't care for the dead, but those thieving pests...\nYou've heard the tales, so you must know that thieving doesn't bear a liking to fair folk. It doesn't matter to me─so long as the fruit is rightfully yours.\nThe pests tend to favor the smaller and less robust of our plants, so I've been forced to replant every time I've lost a single flower. And that's just the half of it.\nThe pests also prey on the less than robust of our animals─so I've been forced to protect my plants with an iron bar. Though that only covers so much ground.\nI could spend all day fending off those winged nightmares, but I've a wife to think about─and a few red roses to put a smile on my face today. So I'll be going back to the drawing board.\nI suppose you'll be the one to solve our pest problem, will you? I can't very well ask you to thin the population of my favorite plant by half, can I?\nWonderful! Well, let's see here...\nOh my, you've reduced the number of pests by half! I can't thank you enough, friend!\nRed roses are so beloved by so many, but we can't have too many of the beauties. You'd think that after all these years of war, the roses would have at least one enemy.\nI don't know what the pugils have been plotting since our last visit, but I daresay it's only a matter of time before they triumph over us all!\nWell, I'll be sure to replant our red roses as soon as I can! You go on ahead and let the others know what a pain this is making them.", '\nVarthon:', "Welcome back. So you've reduced the number of pests by half, have you?\nI can't thank you enough. You've saved me, my friend, and possibly my entire garden!\nOf course, those are mere numbers. If we could keep the population in check, there'd be far more to harvest from the trees that grow here.\nWe can't have too many of the beauties, though. If the pugils triumph over us, there'll be far fewer to plant here, and fewer flowers for Varthon to see blooming.\nThe trees grow to the north and west of here, so if we want to keep the population in check, we'll have to plant less red roses.\nI wonder if that will make Varthon any happier... He's always so happy when I plant a new plant, and this time, nothing is going to change that.\nOh, to think the day would come when I would be putting down my last plant. I can't wait to see what you'll do with it.\nI'm sure you'll have more to tell me when you've finished.", '\nVarthon:', "Welcome back. So you've reduced the number of pests by half, have you?\nI can't thank you enough. You've saved me, my friend, and possibly my entire garden!\nOf course, those

I immediately recognized the handwriting, though I couldn't quite make out the language.\nI couldn't believe it when I opened the scroll and found that the words were written in kana, the native tongue of the people of Kugane. Curious, I went to speak with the soldier, and...he disappeared!\nI don't know what to do!

It's become a struggle to keep them healthy and vibrant.\nI'm sure you can appreciate the trouble we've been through, though. A pity we have no one to turn to for help.\nI suppose there's nothing to it, then.

The soul of a saint, as your instrument will prove.\nNow, to make your dreams come true you must needs place your trust in the hands of an expert craftsman.\nI should not be surprised if the man you seek is one who has performed the same task in the past.\nIf you would know more about such individuals, I suggest you speak with Artorias, another of our guildmasters.', '\nArtorias:', 'I am Artorias, and have been entrusted with the creation of your sacred instrument.\nNow, while I am perfectly content to assist you in the creation of this instrument, I would be most grateful if you could demonstrate to me your desire for quality.\nSimply put, I require a sturdy, stable steel blade suitable for a fine choral instrument. Do not worry about choosing a blade that is overly hard or overly soft─I can handle that.\nWhat you require is a suitable length of rose gold thread. Loosely woven strands of this golden thread can be found at the markets of Ul'dah.\nIf you would rather not wait for me to craft a suitable blade, you may also procure a suitable length of thread by speaking with a merchant named Arlh down near the stables.', '\nArlh:', "A delivery, eh? If you've no other business with me, I presume you're looking for a choral instrument.\nWhat's that? The guildmaster said something about needing a blade of suitable length? I don't doubt he means to produce a ceremonial blade, but I can hardly imagine he would require a piece so long.\nAnd if he truly means to make a ceremonial blade, wouldn't it make sense to use one of the precious metals we bestow upon our choral instruments?\nOf course, he would not require a blade of such length.\nA pity. We do not have a tradition of ordering such a blade, and I was hoping you might be able to find one on your own.\nIf you can find a suitable length of rose gold thread, pray return to me. I will make something out of it.", '\nEsmond:', 'So it is a suitable length of gold thread you found. How does it feel to have forged a piece worthy of a saint's memory?\nI should not be surprised. The souls of many who have passed away have been blessed by the gods with a glimpse of eternity.\nEven so, few realize the beauty of a fine choral instrument. Indeed, a fine choral instrument requires a delicate touch to shine true.\nEven if your design is exquisite, expect no one to pay so much for it. As the guildmaster said, it is not meant to be shared.\nIn that regard, I suppose it is up to you to decide how you wish to present your instrument.\nPlease accept this as a token of my gratitude.', '\nEsmond:', 'I trust you now have a knowledge of what it takes to create a choral instrument of grace.\nI am honored to provide you with the opportunity to craft a piece of history.

I can think of no better a first step in the right direction!\nOh, but before you go, I would ask that you take a moment to speak with Lady Laniaitte.

Henceforth, our priests will be forced to supplement their salary with foodstuffs purchased with the surplus of the local foodstores.\n...Ahem. Sorry about that. I suppose I should have mentioned that bit of formalities.\nAnyway, what I would most insist upon you doing is taking the veil and placing it around your head again.\nI cannot wait to show you its glory!

Dialogue: ['\nHervoix:', "Oh, you're the adventurer from Castellum Velodyna. If you have time, there is something I would ask of you.\nMy brother and I used to be farmers. We planted seeds, harvested seeds, and made a living. But then the Garleans attacked.\nAfter the battle, our families fled here to Doma, but we decided to return to the fields.\nThe fields have been neglected, and the animals have grown more aggressive. We have no choice but to take our animals out in the open, where they can be killed for meat.\nI want to plant seeds in the fields, but I cannot do it alone. I need you to go in my stead.\nPlease, bring me three seeds. I do not have enough hands to handle the task alone.", '\nHervoix:', 'Please, bring me three seeds. I do not have enough hands to handle the task alone.', '\nHervoix:', "Ah, you are back. Were you able to get the seeds?\nThank you so much. I will plant the seeds in the fields now.\nI will take care of the animals. They are my brothers, and I do not want to see them suffer any longer.\nPlease take this as thanks for your help. I will use it to plant more seeds in the fields.\nPlease give my thanks to Father for sending you to me. I will not take my brothers' suffering for granted anymore."]

You'll find him at the Sapphire Avenue Exchange.", '\nNidhogg:', "\nWhat brings a porter to my humble abode?...A Holy book, you say? What an unusual item.

It's not far from here.\nIt was here that the Elder Seedseer received his first copy of the Holy book. It was a precious book, that much I know for certain.\nAfter the Calamity robbed us of the last few volumes, I had no choice but to put them into an archive box and ship them via moogle courier to Nidhogg the porter.\nOf course, I cannot share the exact location of the porter's post. That would be unwise, I'm afraid. If you wish to know, pray speak with him at your leisure.", '\nNidhogg:', "\nWhy would my son ask you to bring me these volumes?...Well, they are, aye. Very precious, they are. As promised, here is your reward.\nI think my son has truly warmed to you. Thank you for all of your help!"]
