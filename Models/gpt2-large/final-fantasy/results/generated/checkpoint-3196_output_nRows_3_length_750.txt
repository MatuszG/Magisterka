Dialogue: ['\nAganbold:', '\nI fear our negotiations with the Eulmoran elite have come to a grinding halt.\nThey refuse to budge an ilm from their position, despite our pleas for moderation.\nWe need you to venture into the Bramble Patch and clear away the imperial soldiers that are entwined in it.\nYou are no ordinary adventurer─you are an Eulmoran elite soldier, are you not?', '\nPop:', '\nYou sense a hostile presence!', '\nAganbold:', "\nYou've returned! I trust you were able to rid the Bramble Patch of the imperials?\nGood work, my friend. I applaud your victory─as does the Eulmoran elite.\nAs you may have noticed, this settlement was once part of the Bramble Patch. Its original owners intended it as a base for their skirmishing forces, but it soon grew to rival the Splendors' Palace in size and importance.\nIt was during one of these skirmishes that a young soldier named Marielle was wounded, and she and her comrades took up residence in the Bramble Patch.\nAfter a fierce battle, in which many of the Eulmorans perished, Marielle emerged as the victor. She and her men decided to remain there, and in doing so laid the foundation for what is now the residential district of Camp Drybone.\nMarielle was a kind and selfless woman, who tirelessly cared for her fellow man. It is fitting that we honor her memory by constructing a home here in the Bramble Patch.\nI am proud that Camp Drybone is named for her, and I hope that it will be a place where neighbors can come together to share memories and celebrate life."]

The hammer itself is a simple but powerful instrument.\nI suggest you practice with it in the appropriate circumstances.\nI'll be here should you need assistance. Come see me when you've learned the techniques. Good fortune to you, adventurer!", '\nDharasame:', "\nYou're back! Good, good. I trust you've learned the technique well?\nYes, yes. I believe we can all learn much from examining the instrument we craft.\nAn instrument is nothing without a hammer in hand to hammer the bits into shape.\nIt is our responsibility as makers to shape the wind to our will, so that we may continue to commune with the spirit world. We must be ever mindful of the dharasame's ability to channel the wind's power.\nNot only does it help us to commune with the spirit world, but it is a vital part of performing our jobs. A dharasame hammer is a tool that we must keep sharp and capable.\nWhen a job calls for the use of a dharasame hammer, we should always have it in hand. It is a fine balance between function and durability.\nI hope you continue to hone your skills and keep finding new opportunities to apply what you've learned. You are a mite further ahead of me than I am.\nYou've done me a great service this day. May Thal's Respite continue to serve you."]

Practice swinging your saw until your arms have learned the motion, then return here.\nI would see you learn more about the nature of the wood, and how it can be used to its fullest potential.\nThis is, of course, but one small step toward realizing your true potential. You must strive to master every facet of the tool you hold in your hand.\nTo help you along, I present you with this hunting log.

I see from the glimmer in your eyes that you're already on the path to enlightenment.\nAs a matter of fact, I think you're ready to begin working on a new composition!\nIt's a simple one, really. Two instrumental pieces, each dealing with a different theme.\nI would very much like you to play one of these pieces in the practice area. Focus on the tune you're working on, and try not to get distracted.\nI realize that this is a long and arduous task, but it will allow you to practice your scales and pick out new sounds.\nNo matter what you face, you must practice!

I was worried that your first attempts might be so lacking.\nYou've grown stronger and braver by practicing. Your progress is truly astounding, Forename.\nIt's thanks to your efforts that I was able to weave these scales in the first place. With them, I was able to capture the spirit of the wood you inhabit.\nYour playing has also helped me to better understand the role of melody in a composition.\nIn my previous piece, I used a simple melody to set the mood. But in this one, I wanted to capture the spirit of a melody with a more flowing quality. I chose the timbre of a bird's song.\nIt's the melody of a beloved song, and one that we Viis must remember. As you've doubtless noticed, the melody of a bird is quite different from that of a man.\nBut where a man's melody is simple, a bird's melody is complex. The difference lies in the way the notes are organized within a song.\nAn organized melody contains the basic notes of a melody, but also variously colored notes that accompany them. A bird's song, on the other hand, contains no such notes, and so the notes are not organized at all.\nThe Viis have always been drawn to music that exuded harmony. But recently, I've found that melody can also convey a sense of peace and tranquility, and that's what I aim to capture in this piece.\nBy playing the melody of a song, you'll be able to bring more life to your music, and I hope that both you and your music will benefit from it.\nThat's not all I have to offer, by the way. I also highly recommend that you practice your scales.\nPractice making small progressions, and then return to me when you're ready to move on.\nLastly, I want to thank you for taking the time to listen to my piece. It was a valuable learning experience for both of us.\nNow, I would give you more advice if I could. If you desire greater challenge, I suggest you seek out the black mages of Gridania. They are known for their mastery of black magic, and their art has been refined over the years.\nIf you wish to hone your skills further, you would do well to seek out the black mages of Gridania.
