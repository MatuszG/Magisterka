I trust you've received the usual harping about from Master Matoya?\nI would be remiss if I neglected my duties, but I fear the tasks have become rather more difficult in recent weeks.\nI could tell a great deal more of my duties by examining the items you've brought me, but as this is the first time I've had to do so in a proper setting, I fear it may be a bit too much to ask of one so new.\nPlease be assured that I will be paying close attention to your every word. I will not fail you again, Forename.\nYou must be wondering why I asked you to bring me these things.\nI believe they may prove to be of use in my research.

I very much look forward to working with them.\nI shall begin by examining the box within. Inside, you will find a small gemstone, which may provide insight into the history of the Allagan Empire.\nI will start by taking out the ingot.\nIt will allow me to examine the workings of the weapon, and perhaps even learn a thing or two about its age.\nBefore I do that, however, there is something I must ask of you.\nWhen you handed me the ingot, I did not ask for any payment. I simply wished to see the object in its current state.\nIf you would like to have a closer look, please come back and I will pay you.\nPlease, take the gemstone and leave the ingot in the box. I will examine the weapon in due time.", '\nVirgeaume:', "\nI trust you've had a chance to look at the weapon?\nYes, it's far too late to change that now.\nMaster Matoya has long held a grudge against the Garleans. The fact that they used the Allagan weapon in their arsenal is all the more reason they should be ashamed of themselves.\nI'm sure you understand, Forename, but the Allagan Empire existed long before the present one.\nIn fact, much of what we know about it comes from ancient texts and myths.\nThey say that the first recorded mention of the Empire comes from a book written in the dying days of the Sixth Astral Era.\nIt describes a great hero named Odin, who united all of the tribes in a single, unified nation.\nIt is said he slew his nemesis, the great serpent Azim, and created the world in his image.\nHowever, much like our own country, the empire was plagued by internal conflicts and constant upheaval.\nIt is said that after Odin's death, his half-brother, Hraesvelgr, assumed the throne.\nThere was a brief but bloody conflict known as the War of the Magi, in which both sides waged relentless war to conquer the other.\nThe victor was ultimately decided by a handful of mages─the so-called magi─who managed to seal Azim within a crystal.\nFor a time, the magi remained hidden from view, but recent studies have revealed that they are, in fact, immortal.\nTheir souls are bound within their weapons, and will not be released until the weapon is used once more.\nThat is all the more reason why I believe these relics are so important. As you can see, their mere existence makes them invaluable.\nIt is for these reasons that I asked you to bring me these tools. I hope to use them in my research.\nOf course, I cannot promise that they will be of much help. As an outsider, I do not always have the best interests at heart, and I will take every opportunity to learn more of the situation.\nThank you again for lending me these tools. I look forward to seeing what discoveries I can make."]

They are so effective at purifying the soil, they naturally become an important part of our agriculture.\nIn fact, I think it is a shame that we do not plant more shrubs and flowers. We could use more nectar from the honeysuckle and goldenrod, but we do not have the necessary space to do so.\nI am glad that you were able to see these flowers.

The sort that must get mistaken for that “Warrior of Darkness” folks've been talking about recently. That right?\nEasy, killer. I couldn't care less who you are or what you've done.

Dikaiosyne's the fiend I'm after─one of the so-called “Cardinal Virtues” as folks are wont to call 'em.\nThere were hopes that somehow the death of Vauthry and the Wardens might've put an end to Dikaiosyne, but alas no. Seems the rules that bind other sin eaters don't apply to the Virtues.\nFormer Warriors of Light─the esteemed “heroes” who saved the realm a century ago. Dear ol' Branden was one of them, I'm told. Stop me if you've heard all this before.\nAnyway, like his comrades, Branden died in the process, only to return relatively recently as a sin eater. The better to torment we few who survived their mercy. Needless to say, I aim to put an end to all that.\nYou've heard the pitch, so what's the answer? You interested in hunting Dikaiosyne with me?\nNot a whit of hesitation. I like you, sinner. Nevertheless, I'll need you to humor me and prove you're the dab hand I think you are. For my sake as well as yours.\nI've heard reports of stray eaters drifting close to the Crystarium. Come with me and put my mind at ease.", '\nGerolt:', "There you are. Very good.\nThe sin eaters we're after were sighted west of the Accensor Gate, so we'll need to head through there before we begin our search.\nOh, and if you happen to have any objections to killing eaters for sport, remember that many were once innocent people. You'll be doing them a favor putting them out of their misery.", '\nGerolt:', "Sorry, but I'll be sitting this one out. Need to make sure I can rely on you in battle first. You understand.", '\nGerolt:', "Good, clean work. This is clearly not your first time.\nLet's do this once more just to confirm it wasn't a fluke, though. Besides the world could do with less sin eaters.\nFollow me. It shouldn't be much further.", '\nGerolt:', "Don't look at me. Your prey is out there somewhere.", '\nGerolt:', "Yeah, that'll do. You're exactly the sort of man I've been looking for, and thank the gods for that.\nMy apologies for subjecting you to such a silly test, but I'd rather not have an amateur's death on my conscience. Let's head back to the Wandering Stairs and make this official, shall we?", '\nGerolt:', "So. Just to make sure you're still keen on our arrangement...\nForename, will you join with me and hunt the dread fiend Dikaiosyne and put an end to his accursed existence?\nExcellent! Then it is settled.\nNow, every hunt begins with an investigation, and ours is no exception. Dikaiosyne can be a rather difficult eater to pin down.\nBut before we commence ours, we would do well to attend to our respective preparations. Let me know when you are ready to proceed."]

And do point out to her that we are not your enemy.\nNow, as you go about preparing the treatise, you may well come across some of our more fervent supporters. These individuals are known to devote their entire lives to the cause. I ask that you keep your distance.\nAnd finally, when you have penned the treatise, deliver it to Brother Isembard. Isembard is a veteran of countless battles, a marauder through and through. He has witnessed the folly of every declaration made by the Allied powers in the wake of the Seventh Umbral Era. Yet he stands firm in the face of every insult thrown his way.\nYou have my sincerest thanks for everything you have done. I look forward to our next mission, and may the blessings of the wood be upon you."]

Dialogue: ['\nGerolt:', "\nReady to begin? Excellent! Let us begin by taking a look at this plan of action.\nI'll admit, I had my doubts that the Alliance would come through with this plan, but I have faith that you, <Clickable(<If(GreaterThan(PlayerParameter(52),0))><Player's Grand Company Rank>)/> Surname, will be the ones to bring the Alliance together, and that you will deliver us from our troubled past.\nBefore we speak of that, though, there is one last thing I would ask of you.\nWhen you arrive in Revenant's Toll, make sure to deliver this resolution to Wlveva.", '\nWlveva:', "\n<Clickable(<If(GreaterThan(PlayerParameter(52),0))><Player's Grand Company Rank>)/> Surname. I am pleased to see that you have come to our aid.\nAs you know, we at the Scions are deeply concerned about the decline of our people. Our House Durendaire scholars are analyzing every piece of data we can find to see how we can prevent this decline.\nWhile we are at it, we have also begun to assemble a cross-disciplinary team of scholars, who will be studying trends in the aetheric and gravitational fields, as well as the role of artificial intelligence in the future.\nAll of this is to be done in an effort to draw out the many possibilities for improvement that our people and our technology may play.\nI have been asked to brief you on our work in greater detail, but I think you will find it enlightening. I hope to have the resolution with you by tomorrow.", '\nGerolt:', "\nSo, we've got this all worked out, eh? Very well. I think we can finally move on to the business of delivering the resolution.\nAfter some deliberation, we decided to focus on three areas of focus: research, development, and policy.\nTo that end, I've tasked my subordinates with leading the respective initiatives.\nNow, while you are doubtless eager to hear more, I would prefer not to rush you. Allow me to explain each one.", '\nSys:', '\nThe Scions of late have been hard at work refining their research in the field of aetheric and gravitational studies.\nThey are currently planning an initiative to gather and analyze all available data.\nThe gathering of this information is intended to pave the way for the development of new aetheric and gravitational theories.\nThe Scions are currently coordinating their efforts with the Alliance researchers in this endeavor.\nShould you have a moment, I would be glad to share some of the work with you.\nOur new initiative will be taking shape in the Near East, and I would be glad if you could assist our allies in their efforts.', '\nWlveva:', "\nOur new initiative will be taking shape in the Near East, and I would be glad if you could assist our allies in their efforts."]

Dialogue: ['\nFlemming:', "\nAs we speak, our garrison prepares to march, leaving you and your fellow soldiers to defend the watchtowers.\nBut we cannot hope to do our duty without your assistance. If you would be so kind as to escort our soldiers to the watchtowers and secure their safety, I would be most grateful.\nThe route to the watchtowers is treacherous, but I would be surprised if any of our soldiers were to perish en route. I ask that you find them and ensure their safety.", '\nPopmessage:', '\nYou are under attack!', '\nFlemming:', "\nOur soldiers are searching for the watchtowers? Excellent.\nI knew I could count on you. When word arrived that they were under attack, I rushed to the scene, only to find that the enemy had already made off with the prisoners.\nBut it avails us naught to dwell on the past. We must focus on what can be done in the present.\nYou have my deepest gratitude, Forename. Safe journey, and Godsspeed."]
