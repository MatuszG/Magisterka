Dialogue: ['\nCibleroit:', "\nWell, well, well...if it ain't my old friend Forename! After your little stunt at the Golden Bazaar, I thought I'd treat you to a little sightseeing at my old stomping grounds.\nThe place you're looking for is a place I once called home─a hamlet called Althyk. It was a workingman's paradise, the perfect place for a man of your pedigree to make his mark.\nBut then the war came and all hells broke loose. The village was abandoned, and the people were forced to flee.\nI was among the first to leave, but I couldn't go far. I knew I was destined for the scrap heap, and so I took up a residence at the Druthers, hoping to scavenge my former glory and make amends.\nIt wasn't long into my absence that word began to spread of the Druthers' plight. A handful of adventurers offered to help in the search, but the number soon grew to include some of the most notorious villains the lawless side of Limsa Lominsa has to offer.\nNeedless to say, the offer was not without its risks. The fiends we chased off this day were not so different from the ones you chased off five years ago...but to suffer the same fate was a hell of a lot worse. I can't thank you enough, friend.\nI don't suppose you've heard the tale, but there was a time when the Golden Bazaar was filled with every manner of adventurer who wanted nothing more than to make a name for themselves in Limsa Lominsa.\nThose days are long gone, however, and the Bazaar is a shadow of its former glory. The place you're looking for is a hamlet called Althyk, one I once called home. It's not much more than a memory these days, but it's my hope that the folk there will remember you for what you were, and will offer you aid should the time come.\nThe druthers is just down the way, so you might want to take a boat there and see what's required of you before you head to Althyk.", '\nCibleroit:', "\nWelcome back, Forename. I hope all went well at the Druthers!\nWelcome back, Forename. I hope all went well at the Druthers!\nAh, you've forgotten all about the Bazaar, I see. It was a fine place to grow up, but the people there deserve better.\nThat's why I intend to make the most of my time here, by volunteering my services to the Resistance. I'll not take no for an answer, friend!\nAs you may have heard, we've had to make a choice─between our old homes and our new ones. And the Bazaar is no exception.\nIn fact, the people of Althyk are being asked to choose between their old lives and joining the Resistance.\nIf you're considering joining the Resistance, I encourage you to speak with the villagers and hear their reasons for choosing the path of Resistance.\nIt's not a decision you'd be wise to make lightly, but if you have the opportunity, I urge you to take it.\nI could see myself joining the Resistance myself, but I've got too much to offer as it is. If there's any place where I'd rather spend my days, it'd be the Druthers!"]
