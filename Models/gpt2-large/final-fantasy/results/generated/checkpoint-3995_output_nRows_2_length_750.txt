A traveler, if I may?', '\nTopher:', "\nI've been thinking, and I've realized it's time I tried something bold.\nBut first, we need to discuss what I've dubbed the “beeautiful plan.”\nYou'll recall the chief's speech at the end of last year, in which he outlined his vision for the future. In it, he called for the creation of a “bio-tech” that could solve many of the world's problems.\nSimply put, my plan calls for the creation of a “beeautiful” microbe that could be expanded into a gigantic comb which could solve a wide variety of problems.\nWhile I have created the necessary conditions for this to work, I need your help to see it through to the end.

As you've likely guessed, a multitude of problems could be solved with the help of this comb, so we'll need to think of a solution which addresses every possible eventuality.\nA good start is to consider how the creature might respond to different kinds of stimuli. For example, if it were to be exposed to a “hot” gas, it might be more inclined to bloom when faced with a “cold” object.\nNext, we need to think of a way to train it. If I were to fashion a comb from a crystal, perhaps the memories of how it was used might be extracted. This might then be used to alter the behavior of the creature in interesting ways.\nLastly, we need to come up with a name for the creature. I decided to go with a flower because of its association with the chief, so I went ahead and named it after one of his favorites.\nOh, and before I forget, please don't tell anyone I'm working with a giant comb. I don't want to cause undue worry for my chief...or anyone else, for that matter.', '\nTopher:', "\nI trust you've gotten a feel for the kind of creature I've dubbed the “bio-tech.” I'll be sure to incorporate any ideas you can think of into the creation process.\nOnce I've finalized the design of the comb, I'll submit it to the Apothecarium for review.\nApothecarium curator Momozigo is responsible for granting permission for researchers to use the creatures in experiments.
