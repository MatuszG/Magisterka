Dialogue: ['\nGisilbehrt:', "\nAh, Forename. Good of you to come. I fear we have no time to speak further of our master's plans. You will find him at the Elezen Archers' Guild in western Thanalan.\nHe is the founder of the Archers' Guild, and its current leader. He is a man of many talents, and his was a path which I did not expect to tread.\nIn order to realize his dream of a guild which is free of discrimination, he sought to unite the talents of all who wish to become archers. And thus did he form the Archers' Guild.\nHe is survived by his wife, Hildibrand, and their three children─Taina, Hildir, and Hildrith.\nThe guild's name is derived from the sacred bow of the ancient peoples, and its members hold it in great esteem.\nIn accordance with his wishes, we at present bear the bow in the highest regard, and will continue to do so until his legacy is recognized.\nSo it is that we are pleased to offer you this gift.\nWhen you first arrived, I was certain you were one of a handful of outsiders, and one of them a troublemaker. Yet from the first, you proved yourself a true friend to the guild, and an equal partner to Hildibrand.\nI could not have done a better job of introducing you to the importance of the gift you have received. May the gods continue to smile upon you."]
