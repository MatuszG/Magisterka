Dialogue: ['\nZlatan:', "\nAccording to Master Gerolt, the resolution Gerolt spoke of was not the one the Alliance leaders had sought but one much longer ago.\nIt was a compromise between the Houses of Ul'dah and House Durendaire that would have granted Ishgard full access to the Sea of Clouds.\nThe problem, however, was that the Serpents refused to accede to the terms of the agreement, and a number of our nation's knights were sent to escort the ships out of the port.\nIt was at this point that Count Edmont de Haillenarte arrived with an escort of knights, prompting the lords and ladies to demand their return.\nThe matter was not lost on the Holy See, which dispatched its envoy to Durendaire to mediate between the houses. Alas, the envoy was attacked and seriously wounded, and has been out of commission for some time.\nIshgard's ambassador to the Holy See, Ser Marcel de Haillenarte, was charged with negotiating the final agreement between the houses. I would be much in your debt if you could seek him out at the Quicksand in eastern Thanalan.", '\nMarcel:', "\nAh, Forename─the man who would be Lord Commander of the Ishgardian Army! Lord Drillemont had the honor of welcoming our esteemed guest to the Holy See.\nIt is an honor and a responsibility both, which is why I was so eager to hear his candid assessment of the final agreement.\nAfter conferring with my counterpart in the House of Commons, I have come to the conclusion that the only way to resolve this matter is to enlist the support of the knights of House Durendaire.\nSuffice it to say, I have had several discussions with my fellow nobles, and all have concluded that enlisting the aid
