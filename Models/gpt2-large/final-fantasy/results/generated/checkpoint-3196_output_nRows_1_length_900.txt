I must learn what it is that they desire, and so make my way to their doorstep.\nHmmm...a prayer for good fortune. “Blessings upon the traveler,” I suppose is the sentiment. I suppose I shall pray for good fortune, and see that it reaches the right people.\nIf I might be so bold, perhaps you could accompany me in my search? It would be a great comfort to have someone to share the burden of my hard work.\nWe will meet again at the Wonders, if you would like to follow me.', '\nEthelred:', 'Pray follow me, that I might explain what I mean to do.', '\nEthelred:', "Welcome back, friend. I trust you had better luck finding those in need than I?\nI see... Well said, indeed. As I said, this is a new settlement and so our numbers are still limited. But we have every confidence that once our doors are opened to those in need, we will welcome them with open arms.\nAnd as I said, it is a new thing for a man of your talents to venture into unfamiliar territory. We are a long way from being able to accommodate everyone, but I have faith that our generous hearts will take us where we need to go.\nIn fact, I believe that our efforts today will bear fruit in the future. I will be sure to keep you apprised of what I have planned."]

Title: A Bargain Struck
Dialogue: ['\nMogoon:', "\nHave you ever seen a trader so heavily armed? I'm talking about that merchant─that bloke with all the gold in his pocket. He's so well-to-do, he could buy the entire moon and still not spend it all on drink and women.\nNo, no trader has ever done that. Even the wealthiest merchants in Amh Araeng are only as rich as their last checkbook.\nThat's why I'm here, to change all that. I'm going to go around and give these ruthless bastards a piece of my mind. I'll make sure they know I'm not happy with their scum.\nI'm going to start by giving them a piece of my mind. I'm going to start with this─a little something to help me get my teeth into them. Do you know where I can find it? Go and give this to the right bloke. You'll find him in the square.", '\nBloke:', "\nWh-What's this? Mogoon's got you buggered, boy!?", '\nBloke:', "\nBloody bastards! They're the worst of the lot! I've got my pride, and I'm a hard worker, but if I can't defend my home, who can?\nI was a carpenter before I fell in with the Mogoon gang. I built my livelihood hauling logs and building forts. But after the earthquakes, the markets took a nose dive, and I had to take up carousing.\nNow I make my living selling weapons to adventurers like you. It's a good living, it is, but I can't keep up with demand if I'm selling at half my usual price.\nIf I don't get my hands on that new piece of materia, I'll never be able to make my living. It's for your own good, boy─don't you agree!?"]
