I must thank you for this.\nI should mention, however, that the bees you've slain are nymphae, which are native to Thanalan.\nI'm certain you know of the dangers they pose to our city, but exterminating nymphae is a job for a more capable adventurer such as yourself.\nShould you decide to undertake this task, I ask that you do it with haste. There are few things more dangerous than nymphae, and you'll want to get rid of them as soon as you possibly can."]
