Title: A Bold Decision
Dialogue: ['\nOsmond:', "\nI can't say I've ever been so excited to hear the word of my new creation.\nI don't mean to brag, of course─I'm merely a man of my time, and I've never been one for exaggeration.\nBut I'll tell you a story that'll bring your heart to your head.\nA man who looks like he's about to turn thirty had a dream, a dream of making a fortune in his village.\nHe asked his wife to look after the children, and to give them a proper name.\nBut as you might imagine, he wasn't exactly thrilled with the idea of having to do it himself.\nHe even went so far as to ask that her husband give them a name─an idea she eventually agreed to.\nBut before she could take the children's name, she had to learn the full story.\nShe took her husband's name, and searched the village for any other names he might have used. She found one─a name that reminded her of her husband.\nWhen she heard it, she knew she had found her dream.\nShe called it “Osmond's Oath,” and it was taken from the ancient oath of his people.\nThe name is a reminder of the oath of his people, and it's a reminder of the oath of his wife.\nAnd so the name has become a symbol of the love that we share.\nAnd I hope that you'll find it fitting to have your name as well."]
