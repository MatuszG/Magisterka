Dialogue: ['\nZlatan:', "\nAccording to Master Gerolt, the means by which emotional energies are committed to the Resistance weapons is perhaps the most crucial part of the refinement process.\nSomehow, the House of Splendors has contrived a means to instigate a mode of emotional resonance not unlike that which you yourself exhibited during your duel with Regana.\nWe must needs ascertain the exact method employed, and if possible, replicate its efficacy.\nI would have you and your fellow researchers attend to this task in our stead.

I have asked him to wait outside the House of Splendors for you.', '\nZlatan:', "\nYou are returned! Have you the Resistance weapon I asked for?\nExcellent. Let us proceed to the testing chamber.\nBefore we begin, I must make it clear that the results of these tests are not to be taken as representing an official approval of the Resistance weapon.\nRather, they are to be considered merely indicative of the potential of the method used to generate the resonance.\nIt is my understanding that, had the Resistance weapon been approved, subsequent developments would have been guided by the intended purpose.\nHowever, the High Houses are not to be trusted when it comes to such matters. We must seek the true intentions of the manufacturer, and that can only be done through rigorous testing.\nNow, if you will excuse me, there is something I would like to attend to while I inspect the Resistance weapon.\nI will return once I have finished speaking with the representative of the House of Splendors.
