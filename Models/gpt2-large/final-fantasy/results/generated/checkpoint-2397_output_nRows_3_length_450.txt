I mean to say, I'm pleased to be proven wrong, but not surprised. The reason we devised this plan, after all, was that the bees that were being blamed for the deaths of thirty honeybees had, in fact, been feeding on the pests. In order to cull the population, we decided to eliminate the most aggressive individuals, but this proved problematic, as most of the others were too timid to take up the bait. As it turned out, a single bee wasn't enough to do the trick, so we split the work between four of our soldiers. However, in doing so, they unintentionally slaughtered thirty more of the pesky buggers, which caused a great deal of distress. Naturally, the loss of such a vital resource was a disaster, and we were forced to enact a draconian extermination plan. In addition to those who perished in the combing, we've culled two more who've taken up residence within the apiary, and we've cut down a third who's been napping around out there. Of course, the plan was hardly foolproof, but it did its job. You'll see to the remaining bees as well, of course? Good work, Forename. It's not every day you see a beekeeper in action, but you've done us all proud. Now, back to the matter at hand.

Dialogue: ['\nMinfilia:', "\nI cannot help but be reminded of our first visitor from Eulmore, a man who was both a scholar and a warrior.\nAs he grew to become one of Ishgard's greatest heroes, however, he eventually came to be known more simply as “Namira.”\nNamira was a master of the bow, and her greatest masterpiece was the “gigima.” She used it to devastating effect in the battle against the Dravanians, destroying their entire army in the process.\nIt was during that battle that her research on the element of light was first revealed. The element itself is an extremely powerful one, and its power was deemed so vital that it was inscribed upon the Amalj'aa scalekin's heads, along with a warning that should they absorb too much of it, their souls would be torn apart.\nNamira believed that using her newfound knowledge in the battle would ultimately result in the victory of her people. Therefore, she devoted her life to studying the element, and in doing so, she came to discover a way to attune a weapon to her will.\nIn time, she succeeded in creating a weapon so powerful that even she herself could use it. The weapon was known as “Namira's scalekin,” and it was gifted to her by a member of the Eulmoran elite─the Guardian of the Scaled Circle.\nI must say, the decision to grant her this weapon was incredibly difficult, as I am sure you can appreciate. The element itself is a master of the wielder, and it was for this reason that the Eulmoran elite chose to create a weapon of their own.\nI am told that the weapon was a masterpiece, and that the Guardian himself coveted it. Even after he had acquired it, however, he could not bring himself to part with it.\nNamira was furious with him for failing to hand it over, and in a fit of rage, she destroyed the weapon in a fit of rage.\n

Dialogue: ['\nVorsaileheuloix:', "\nWe have received word from Gridania that the aetherial disturbance caused by the awakening of the primal has subsided.\nIn addition, Master Garlond has approved the construction of a new chocobo stables in Gridania's Central Shroud.\nThe stables were originally intended to house the fledglings of refugees displaced by the Calamity, but they now house the fledglings of adventurers.\nThe new stables are being constructed near the Central Shroud, to the northwest of the Central Shroud Gold Saucer.\nAs of yet, there are no plans to assign any of the fledglings to a particular stables, but it is hoped that they will all eventually find their way to their new home.\nMy thanks to you, Forename.\nIt is well that the exodus from the Central Shroud has come to an end. In its wake, the primal has left the Twelveswood in disarray, and the refugees scattered across the central highlands.\nMany of the refugees remain in Ul'dah, and some even make their way as far as Coerthas.\nYet few are willing to settle in the Central Shroud. The exodus had the unintended effect of encouraging the exodus's other side─the Dravanians─to take up residence in the Twelveswood.\nThis has complicated matters for the Holy See, which has been charged with attempting to pacify the refugees.\n...And the Holy See has been charged with doing so, as well. The Holy See has petitioned the aid of the Scions, and the Grand Companies, to assist in their efforts.\nIn addition to the aid they have already rendered, the Holy See has requested additional aid from the three main nations─Kal Myhk, Gridania, and Nabaath Areng─as well as the cooperation of foreign countries.\nIt is our hope that the aid we have extended will prove to be as effective as we had hoped.\nI wish to thank you once more for your service, Master Surn

Dialogue: ['\nGildon:', "\nWell, I'd best get back to work─no need to linger over here, it's the manufactory's turn to do the heavy lifting.", '\nGildon:', "\nThe manufactory's been on a tear of late, and if nothing else, their latest creation deserves a well-earned rest.\nI mean to make a musical instrument myself, but as you might imagine, no one's made one before...so I'm searching the markets for one.\nI would make it myself, of course, but the elementals have been so kind to me, I've been unable to procure one of their own. I'd sooner boil me own head than part with one from a rival, so if you happen to stumble across an alchemist selling such a thing, would you mind making the delivery?", '\nGildon:', "\nWould you mind making the delivery? I'd sooner boil me own head than part with one from a rival, so if you happen to stumble across an alchemist selling such a thing, would you mind making the delivery?", '\nGildon:', "\nAh, my new creation! I hope it lives up to its reputation─I've heard nothing but excellent things about it.\nYou see, the elementals gave it form, so when the core is broken, a unique, magical resonance occurs. That's what makes the horn's sound unique, and what makes it the instrument of choice for folk such as myself.\nI'm sure you've already heard the praise─what with its soothing tone and invigorating effects, it's a wonder the elementals didn't deem it worthy of their attention.\nI'm confident my instrument will bring a smile to the faces of all who behold it. Take it from me, this is a worthy gift─and a gift that'll last a lifetime!"]
