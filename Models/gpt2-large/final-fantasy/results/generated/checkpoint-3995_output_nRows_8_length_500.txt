You see, I was asked to procure a forbidden substance by a Wood Wailer, and on the off chance that it ended up in the wrong hands, I was asked to recover it myself.

The Exarch was none too pleased to see his precious wares going to waste, to put it mildly.\nNow, you might be wondering why this would be of interest to the Wood Wailers. Well, it's not like they were buying the substance on a whim. They knew I was dealing in an illegal market, and were well aware that I wasn't above the law.\nThe question is, why did they want this substance in the first place? Well, there's a theory that suggests the reason they sought it was to send a message to the Gridanian Resistance.\nAfter the defeat of Garuda, the Wailers believed that their purpose had been fulfilled─that the gods had delivered them from their darkness─and that the world had changed for the better. That is why they sought to send a message to the Gridanian Resistance, you see.\nIf you can look past the fact that this is rather old-fashioned stuff, you may discover a rather interesting theory. It goes like this:\nThe Wood Wailers were sent to warn the Garleans of the coming darkness, and that their purpose was fulfilled in the defeat of Garuda. That is why they wished to send a message to the Gridanian Resistance.\nNow, I know what you're thinking: why would the Wailers be interested in sending a message to a foreign power? Well, they were, after all, still dealing in the same black markets as before.\nIn any case, I wouldn't be holding up my end of the bargain if I denied them their prize.

He commands a tight-knit and disciplined force, but he rarely strays far from his post.\nAlas, the Dzemael are not fools. They know that the Horde is stronger than they, and that the Dzemael cannot be made to yield. Hence their decision to employ the Immortal Flames.\nTo ensure their victory, they have recruited famed adventurer Gavin to their cause. Gavin is a man of many titles, but he is best known for his role as the brawny but loyal bodyguard of the late Lord Commander Merlwyb Swyft.\nHe is Gavin's equal in skill and experience, and his presence in the field will be felt most keenly by the Dzemael.\nIt is for this reason that I have chosen you to represent the Maelstrom at the council. Your presence will be felt most keenly by the Dzemael, you will understand.", '\nCid:', '\nGavin is an accomplished adventurer, and a true friend of the Maelstrom.
