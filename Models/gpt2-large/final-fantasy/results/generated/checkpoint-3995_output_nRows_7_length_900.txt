Dialogue: ['\nAuphiliot:', "\nWell met, adventurer. May I call you Forename? I wish to place on record that I did in fact purchase that paltry sack of yours.\nThe transaction was carried out with the utmost propriety─though I admit I had my pride as well. I was simply offering it to a servant of House Durendaire as a gift, and she took it upon herself to deliver it to an Ul'dahn merchant who happened to be passing through Carteneau.\nI can scarce believe it now, but it was not an uncommon occurrence...er, that is, until now.

It is a shame he did not bother to say so sooner! The man is a good lad, but I'm afraid he has yet to deliver the gift.\nIt is of little wonder that the House Durendaire servant who sold me the sack of goods has yet to return. She was adamant that it was all mine to give, and I have not been back for some time.", '\nAuphiliot:', '\nSo it is true that you were able to purchase said paltry sack of mine. May I ask you what you feel about that?', '\nAuphiliot:', "\nWell...it is hardly a reflection on your character that the House Durendaire servant who sold you the goods has yet to return. In fact, I'm sure she would be delighted to have you return and give her the details of the transaction.\nIt is a pity, but not entirely unexpected. House Durendaire has yet to establish itself as a proper lord and lady, and it is not entirely within my capacity to change that.\nI will be sure to convey my apologies to her, and ask that she continues to keep the good reputation of House Durendaire. I cannot imagine she will be willing to forgive me, however...\nIn any case, I thank you for furnishing me with the information. It is now clear that not all merchants are wont to act with propriety when dealing with the Ul'dahns.\nI will not deny a personal favor from you, Forename. In fact, I think it a great honor. Pray accept this as a token of my appreciation."]

Yet I have no doubt that, should it come to pass, I will be at their side, ready to give their lives for theirs.\nEver since that day, I have been haunted by visions of my fallen comrades, torment graven upon my soul.\nI know not how to thank them for their wish, but please accept this as a token of my gratitude."]

If you wish to give the horn a try, pray return to me once your task is complete.

They object that the horns I have made are too simple, that they lack the complexity and beauty that they claim.\nIf there is one thing I have learned in my time as a researcher, it is that one must not take perfectionism so seriously. If one is satisfied with the results of one's work, one must not only make it better, but deliver it to the listener with all haste.\nIn short, I am confident that my work will satisfy even the most critical of listeners.\nThis brings me to my final point...and my greatest hope.\nIf I am successful in my endeavor to bring the wisdom of our forebears to the world, I am confident that I will receive a personal invitation to play at the symphony.\nIf all goes according to my latest calculations, I should be able to offer my new music instrument to the guild in time for the next performance.\nOh, how ambitious this course of action is, but I have no doubt that I will make it worth your while. I shall be waiting for you at the guild.", '\nYda:', "\nOh, Forename!

We wouldn't be able to make our delicious food if not for the souls who prepare it, and it is the soul that gives our wares their flavor.\nAnd when someone asks you what you do for a living, the first thing that comes to mind is your church.\nNow, I'm sure that you are wondering whom this gift is for. It is for a good cause, after all.\nThe food that I prepare is meant to be shared. That is why I wanted to make sure that the person on whose behalf the gift was being given could take pride in it.\nAnd I am so happy that I was able to make that request!

Title: A Brave Resolution
Dialogue: ['\nUrianger:', "In the midst of the chaos that erupted, our House of Commons gathered to consider the resolution of the House of Commons.\nThe House of Commons was comprised of three houses─the nobility, the commonfolk, and the Temple Knights.\nThe latter was the order of the Temple Knights, who had recently taken charge of the defense of the Holy See.\nAlas, our esteemed commander was wounded during the struggle, and could not attend the assembly.\nHis absence did not bother the House of Commons, who took it upon themselves to elect a new commander.\nThey chose Basch as their choice, and he duly took his place at the helm.\nUnfortunately, a number of the nobles and their retinues sought to undermine the new commander's authority, and a scuffle erupted in the hall.\nBasch fought well, but his wounds were grievous. He was brought here for treatment, but it seems his wounds were not treated with the appropriate care.\nAnd now he languishes in this bed, unable to move.\nNo one seems to care─not even the noblemen themselves.\nWe do all we can to support our brave commander, but the wounds he sustained are too grave to be ignored.\nHe must be given the air of a man in need, for his sacrifice will not be forgotten.\n...And so I ask that you speak with the other members of the House of Commons, and urge them to rise to the occasion.\nIt would not do to have another bloodbath in the Holy See.\nI understand that some might see this as a mere domestic matter, but the future of the Holy See is not to be taken lightly."]
