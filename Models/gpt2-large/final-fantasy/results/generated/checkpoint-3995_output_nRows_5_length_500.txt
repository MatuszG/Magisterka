Dialogue: ['\nGildon:', "Well, well, if it isn't my old mate─and a more deserving one at that─back from his latest foray into the bazaar.\nI'm sure you've heard the rumors, but these underground markets are a true gem of the black arts.\nEvery transaction is scrutinized by the Order of the Twin Adder, and every customer submitted to a thorough inspection.\nAnd what do you know? Not one problem found! Not one.\nOrdinarily, I'd be beside myself with envy─that my mate would be able to handle such a task was a miracle born of his genius and unrivaled resourcefulness. Alas, my duties have kept me here for the past two moons, and I've been unable to devote the necessary time to my studies.\nBut you've proven yourself a worthy adversary and a true partner to my mate in this, and I believe you deserve a reward for your services. Will you consent to assist me in my endeavor?\nWonderful! I will send word to the Congregation of Fourteen and ask them to assemble a squad to conduct a thorough investigation of these markets.\nWhen they arrive, I will tell them of your assistance and ask that they seek out Mistress Rowena in Revenant's Toll.\nI realize that this may seem like an excessive amount of effort on your part, but I assure you that your reward will be well worth the effort.", '\nGildon:', "Ah, Forename. I trust you've completed your inspection of the markets?\nAye, everything appears to be in order.\nI've entrusted the squad with two orders─a bounty for those who provide essential services and a debt collection for those who cannot.\nI've also instructed them to issue a bounty to any adventurer who submits himself for inspection─be it a friend, acquaintance, or stranger.\nNow, I've no doubt that you're eager to part with your reward, so let me know when you're ready to accept it.\nWonderful! I will share the bounty with you and allow you to collect your debt.\nI've also asked that you inform my comrades at the Congregation of Fourteen that you've performed admirably in their investigation.\nI've made it quite clear that any adventurer who

But then the Ul'dahn merchants drove me out of my home and robbed me of all my property. I suspect that was instigated by the Vanu.\nI am a victim as well, for I was promised a life of luxury and honor, and instead I have received naught but poverty and shame.\nWhat I would have you do is speak with the merchant who dealt with Arenvald and demand his account of the incident. That way, you might be able to show your sincerity and earn his trust.", '\nCarrilaut:',

Title: A Bold Decision
Dialogue: ['\nKumozi:', '\nThe Admiral will have made his decision by now─assuming he hasn't already.', '\nKumozi:', "\n...Really? Really!?\nTo surrender oneself to Nidhogg's siren song... Is this truly the will of the Admiral?\nMy lord, I beg of you. Surrender yourself to Nidhogg's siren song, and be done with it.\nYou would do well to remember that the song is not your to dole, but the Admiral's. He will hear you are being ignored, and that your pleas are not being heeded.\nI realize this is sudden, but might I trouble you to return to Ul'dah and convey my gratitude to the man who made the call?", '\nKumozi:', '\nI am most grateful, my lord.\nI will not pretend otherwise. I made the call, and I made it with no doubts in my mind. This is a moment I would rather not remember had I been not the one making the call.\nBut to speak of the decision itself... I had been considering my options for quite some time. I knew I could count on the support of the Scions, but I also knew the Admiral would not want a repeat of the incident.\nUltimately, I concluded that I could not well end my own life in the Admiral's stead. But I could well hope to save him, should the opportunity ever presents itself.\nAye, the decision was not easy. But I made it on the understanding that my fellow Scions would stand with me, that the future of Eorzea would not be decided in Ul'dah.\nAnd so I ask you, my lord: grant me the strength to endure the inevitable, and be the strength that saves our realm."]

I've been waiting for you─and for a worthy adversary to meet me!\nA new challenger has come to challenge my title of greatest warrior, and I want you to put him down!\nIn the Octagon, there are two paths to travel. On one path are the Kojin of the Red and the Kojin of the Blue, who each have their own unique techniques.\nI have heard that one of your strength lies in your ability to read body language, as well as your uncanny knack for fighting with a flurry of strikes. I require both of you to put down these menacing adversaries!\nI will provide you with a kamaitachi, a wooden sword with a razor-sharp edge. This will allow you to slice your opponent apart with ease, making him vulnerable to your next blow.\nI would also suggest wearing heavy armor, as your opponent will be made of steel. That is, assuming you are not otherwise occupied. In which case, I suggest you seek out the Masher of the Blue, who resides in the midst of the Kojin of the Red. That being the man who last time you came face to face, I daresay he can provide you with what you seek!", '\nWawarukka:', '\nThe Kojin of the Red are represented by the Masher of the Blue, who resides in the midst of the Kojin of the Red.
