He passed away when I was still young, and I was given it by my uncle when I turned twenty-one.\nIt is a testament to his love for the wood and the hunt that he chose to keep it with him through thick and thin.\nI've been hunting ever since I was able to walk, and I would be lying if I said my love for the hunt wasn't the reason I chose this hunting knife.\nBut as you can see, hunting's not always about the thrill of the hunt. Sometimes, you just want to do what you're told.\nSo when my father passed, I couldn't stand to leave him. He's the reason I started this band, and the reason I continue to hunt. I know I'll be fine, and I hope you'll too. Thank you for your help."]

Dialogue: ['\nFufucha:', "Ah, Forename, as always. I am pleased to inform you that the Aetherochemical Research Facility has been awarded an exclusive contract to produce a unique musical instrument.\nAs you may know, the facility is home to an experimental musical instrumentation known as the “golden horn”─a prototype of which was recently completed at the Elezen Research Facility.\nNaturally, the Aetherochemical Research Facility has been eager to see this unique creation brought to life, and has thus enlisted the services of renowned musicologist Thierremont.\nThierremont is a master of all things musical─from conducting symphonic orchestras to crafting elaborate stringed instruments, he is a true master of his art.\nSo it is that we have agreed to work with the goldsmith for this particular commission.\nAnd I trust that you are well aware of the significance of this arrangement─I speak not only for myself, but for my entire organization.\nThis is an extremely important agreement. Not only does it secure the future of this sector─and indeed, of all Eorzea─but it also represents an important step forward for music education in general.\n...And you are certain to agree with me that it was worth the wait. Listen carefully, for I shall explain everything in due course.\nNow, as you may have already gathered, the golden horn is a prototype of the sort that could be created only within the confines of a “crystal”─an extraordinary material with the ability to absorb and reabsorb sound energy.\nOf course, nothing could be further from the truth. The crystal, in fact, was invented by none other than Thierremont himself.\nThe horn itself, however, is a wholly different matter.\nWhen the crystals first appeared, they were seen by no one as anything but an expensive curiosity, unworthy of a specialist's attention. That attitude changed, however, following the appearance of the first practical applications for the crystals, which began with the development of amplification techniques.\nNow, it is well and good that amplification techniques are used to further enhance the capabilities of musical instruments, but it is equally well that the art of amplification is applied to musical instruments in their development.\nThe golden horn is a manifestation of this shift─it is an amplification of the musical instrument itself, an instrument capable of absorbing and reattracting sound energy.\nNow, I would like you to take this amplification and adapt it to your musical instrument.\nBefore we can do so,
