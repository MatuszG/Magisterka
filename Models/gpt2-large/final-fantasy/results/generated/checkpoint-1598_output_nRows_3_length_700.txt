You see, the old man was one of the greatest hunters in all Gridania.\nNow, however, he is on the lam, for he has gone missing.\nHis wife has sent word of his whereabouts, and I have decided to search for him in the nearby fields.\nI have already seen my fair share of beasts, and I am no stranger to the hunt, but I am not so skilled as to be able to handle the creatures alone.\nIf you are willing to help, please seek out the fields to the south of here. There is a large herd of lambs there, and I would be much in your debt if you could slay them.', '\nFaezahl:', '\nPlease slay any lambs that come to graze on the fields to the south of here.', '\nFaezahl:', '\nWere you able to find the missing hunter?', '\nFaezahl:', "\nOh, thank you! I have never seen such fine hunting technique.\nI have no idea where the hunter might have gone, but I pray he is not hurt. I shall have to thank you personally for this.\nIt is my duty to keep track of all who enter the Greatwood. Please do not let any of my duties distract you from your search."]

Dialogue: ['\nDmitar:', "Blade Surname! I have a mission for you.\nYou see, I was recently informed that the Alliance leaders have agreed to establish a new military unit within the House of Splendors.\nWe are to be the vanguard of this new initiative, and I would have you assist us in our preparations.\nYou will find our new recruit, Ser Marcelain, over at the airship landing. Be warned, however, that he is a rather difficult man to track down─he may well be on his way to join the rest of the garrison.\nYou will also want to make sure Ser Marcelain is present for the briefing, as he is the man in charge of recruiting new members of House Durendaire.\nI have also heard word that House Durendaire has established a new airship route direct to the front line. Given the nature of our work here, it may not be possible to fly to the front line in time for the briefing, but if you could make the trip, I would be most grateful.", '\nMarcelain:', "Blade Surname, have you come to join the House of Splendors?\nMy lord, we are ready to march to the front line.\nWhat I would not give to be there with you!\nBut first, I must needs attend to preparations for the airship landing.\nIf you will excuse me, my lady.\nI have been looking forward to seeing you, Blade Surname. I have heard much and more of your exploits here at the front.\nYou have my sincerest gratitude, Blade Surname.\nIt will be a pleasure to have you aboard the House Durendaire airship.\nAnd as I said, House Durendaire has established a new airship route direct to the front line. Given the nature of our work here, it may not be possible to fly to the front line in time for the briefing, but if you could make the trip, I would be most grateful.", '\nDmitar:', 'Blade Surname! You are back. I trust you have spoken with Ser Marcelain?\nWell, I must say, he is a rather difficult man to track down...\nBut I have to say, he has made a fine recruit. I am certain he is eager to help House Durendaire in their preparations for the airship landing.\nI have also heard word that House Durendaire has established a new airship route direct to the front line. Given the nature of our work here, it may not be possible to fly to the front line in time for the briefing, but if you could make the trip, I would be most grateful.']
