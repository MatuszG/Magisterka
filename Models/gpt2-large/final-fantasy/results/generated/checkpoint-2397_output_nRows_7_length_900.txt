A small part of this is thanks to the hunters, but the main reason is due to the tuktu themselves.\nI am loath to see that tradition end, but I would ask you to do me a favor in returning a portion of their bounty.\nPlease go and inform the others that the tuktu hunt is no longer a simple affair.

Dialogue: ['\nFufucha:', "\nWe are at war, Forename. And I mean that in a good way.\nWe have a common enemy─the parasitic mite. It is an enemy to bees, and a death sentence for any who gets in its way.\nBut we can't simply wipe it off the face of the earth. We need a more effective way to combat it. And that is where you come in.\nYou see, the mite is a member of the parasitic family, and like all members of that family, it has a hive-mind. The hive-mind decides what to do with the mite, and if any part of the hive is killed, the whole is killed.\nFor this reason, we have developed a method of trapping the mite in a special cannon. This method, however, is somewhat disorganized, and there are still a few mite wandering about in the wild.\nOne of these mite-hunters, however, spotted a nest of parasitic bees nearby. The bee-keeper then rushed there, and after a short scuffle, managed to capture a few of the pests.\nIt is not easy to capture a large number of the mites in a confined space such as this, so the hunter went to the nest and collected a large number of them.\nI must say, this is a truly heroic deed. It is an understatement to say that I am proud to have been able to aid this hunter.\nI trust you will take good care of the mite-hunters. You need only return to me once you have caught enough.

Dialogue: ['\nE-Sumi-Yan:', "Greetings, Forename. The time has come for you to make a brave and courageous decision.\nYou may be forgiven if you have been worried about your friend. He has been quite a chatterbox of late, and lately has been grumbling something to himself about the nature of reality.\nI fear he may have taken his frustration out on you, and I would ask you to put him out of his misery.\nI have created for you a new bracelet, which will allow you to call upon the wisdom of the wood when you are ready to make the decision.\nWhen you are ready to make the decision, simply present the wood to me, and I shall see that it is indeed what you seek.\nShould you have any further questions or experience any difficulties, I would be happy to answer them.\nPlease do be careful when using the wood─do not let its natural energies overwhelm you.\nI look forward to seeing you again, Forename. My sincerest apologies if this has caused you undue distress.\n", '\nE-Sumi-Yan:', 'I am pleased to say that the decision you made was indeed what you wanted.\nHowever, as you may have noticed, my friend has not been idle since his return.

You will be pleased to know that his most recent creation is a gift from me.\nIt is a creation of the wood, and it is adorned with a symbol of life. You may have seen it in the form of a crystal, but now it is a living creature.\nYou see, the crystal represents the life that has ever lived, and as such it is inseparable from the life that will ever live. As such, it is a living thing that cannot be destroyed.\nWith this in mind, I am confident that the bracelet you made can serve as a powerful reminder of the wisdom of the wood.\nNow, that you understand the significance of the decision, you may be free to return to your work. It is past time you learned how to use the power of the wood in more constructive ways.']
