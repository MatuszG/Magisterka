Dialogue: ['\nMogmont:', "\nAh, my dear boy. I am glad you're safe.\nI suppose this is the time I should tell you how I helped my father make a remarkable find. He was traipsing around the Forgotten Knight when he happened upon a sword buried in the earth. He paid a visit and picked it up.\nIt was a gift from his family and they made a handsome profit selling it. However, the family sold it at a terrible loss and Mogmont lost everything.\nBut what was worse was that the sword was cursed. It was said to possess terrible powers and had been passed down through generations.\nMogmont was determined to track down his family and reclaim it, but he was hopelessly lost. He eventually gave up and went into hiding.\nIt was then that I was able to track him down and reclaim the sword for him. I'll be sure to tell you how I did it when I meet you.", '\nMogmont:', '\nThank you for your help. Here, take this as a token of my gratitude.', '\nMogmont:', '\nThe sword belonged to my father, who passed it down through generations. He was a diligent carpenter and worked tirelessly to build a home for us.\nUnfortunately, he could never make good on his promise to build a home for us, and the family scattered when the fighting started.\nI wanted to take the sword home myself, but my father wouldn't let me. That's when I was forced to turn to you.\nMy father said that you were the man I had been looking for. I'm sure he was right. Thank you for taking the time to find him.']

Might you mind taking this briefcase to the manor directly in front of the Research and Development building, and giving him this notice, as well as the gift of a hearty congratulations on your behalf?"]

The Mogret was abandoned to the Empire, and its ruins were reclaimed by the Resistance.\nTo this day, the Mogret remains one of the most wondrous monuments in Vylbrand.\nYet, to truly understand where the Mogret stands today, one must know more of the history of the Empire.\nThat is why I would ask you to gather allies from across the realm, from the brave men and women who guard the south gate to the brave warriors who brave the enemy's lair.\nAnd I would ask you to do so without hesitation. For if you do not, I shall feel as if I have no recourse but to take matters into my own hands.', '\nMogret:', '\nYou have gathered a band of allies, and now it is time I called on you to make a bold decision.', '\nMogret:', '\nDo you believe the Mogret's words and deeds mean more than words?

You see, I am in need of a capable adventurer to help me with a very delicate task.\nYou see, the Order of the Twin Adder has decreed that we must all wear armor made of high-quality magitek armor if we are to protect the Twelveswood from the Dravanian Horde.\nUnfortunately, there is a problem with obtaining the requisite quantity of magitek armor.\nYou see, one of the orders─the Garleans─uses magitek armor as their main source of weaponry. And now they want us to procure a large amount of their magitek armor in order to make a stand.\nThe problem is, we cannot simply ask the Order to send us what they need.
