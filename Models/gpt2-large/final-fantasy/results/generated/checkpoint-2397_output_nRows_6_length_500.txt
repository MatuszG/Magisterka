He used no less than fifty different kinds of wood, from maple sap to crystal clear, to achieve his master's desired effect.\nThis is an extraordinary find, and I am honored to have the opportunity to present it to you.

I am also the proud owner of a rather unusual phial─one of a kind only found in the city of Ul'dah.\nWhile I am most pleased to have made the acquaintance of one of your kind, I am equally pleased to report that the phial in question is well-preserved, and fit for a future experiment.\nWhile the details of your expedition are most interesting, I am more curious to see what you will find upon your return. Will you bring me the phial?", '\nCeana:', 'Bring me the phial. And do make sure not to drop it!', '\nCeana:', "The phial is within the coffer, just inside the door.\nOh, and if you should happen to drop it, please do not worry─I will see to it it it lands safely in your lap.\nHm? Oh, yes, the phial. It is just a normal sized stone phial, except that its bottom is lined with a gold-like substance.\nWhen placed in the right place, this produces a peculiar, crystalline effect. I have yet to test it, but I hope that future experiments will yield results indistinguishable from those produced with ordinary phials.\nThat said, I do not expect that our explorations will lead us to any answers regarding the nature of time itself. I am more interested in exploring how we might use this knowledge to create new methods of travel, and the potential applications of ancient artifacts.\nI will send word to my colleague in Ul'dah to organize further research. My thanks for your continued cooperation, and please return to me once you have made sufficient progress.']

I would also strongly advise you to attune to the aetheryte here if you would like to do so forthwith.\nYou will find the aetheryte to the northeast of here, within the Fractal's power node.
