I see no reason not to trust that reputation.\nYou see, we've been working to develop a new type of weapon, and it was decided that the first test subjects would be the Ironworks.\nThis was decided after we received word that they were looking for a suitable candidate for their next weapon, so it's only right that they put their best foot forward.\nAfter all, you can't call a weapon an experimental weapon if it doesn't work─it's only one step down the road.\nWell, I must say, I'm quite impressed. The quality of this work is truly out of this world.\nI've heard reports that the quality of the work at the Ironworks is on par with the best of our work.\nI've also heard reports that the quality of the work is on par with the best of our work. Well done, Forename!\nYou've now completed your first test subject. Now all you need do is deliver the next test subject to us.\nThat's a relief, I must say! I was worried that the quality of the work would suffer for this delay.\nBut no, I can tell that you are up to the task.\nI can only imagine the amount of work that went into developing this weapon. I hope that it meets with approval from the Ironworks, and that we'll be able to bring you great results in the future.\nI'll take this opportunity to thank you for your work. I look forward to seeing what you'll achieve in the future.\nOh, and if you have any further questions, I'm always here to answer them."]
