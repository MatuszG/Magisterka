Dialogue: ['\nSisipu:', '\nThe Silver Bazaar has been in the throes of a trade boom of late, and the merchant community is no exception.\nIn fact, our nation's capital is home to some of the most luxurious homes in all of Thanalan.\nThere are just a few things that must be done to maintain the current stock of luxury goods, however, and one such task is procuring the rare ingredients our countrymen so dearly covet.\nOne such ingredient is the liver of a giant hornbark─a particularly delectable meat found in the jungles of central Thanalan.\nThe meat, however, can only be had from creatures native to the region, and so I am in need of the assistance of adventurers like yourself.\nPlease hurry, before the hunters return with their livers and the markets are glutted with their delicious wares.', '\nSisipu:', '\nI am pleased to say I have procured the liver of a giant hornbark─a particularly delectable meat found in the jungles of central Thanalan.

I trust you have procured the liver of the giant hornbark?\nSplendid! I can make good use of this beast's meat without resorting to other methods.\nI shall use it to feed my men, you see, and I believe a portion of the proceeds from the sale of its liver shall go towards improving the nation's agriculture.', '\nSisipu:', "\n...Hm? How are you supposed to feed my men when you have yet to procure the liver of a giant hornbark?\nWell, it's a miracle that I even managed to track down such a delicious specimen.\nI had the utmost faith that you would be able to find the beast, but to think you would actually meet me halfway─to actually ask for help─is a testament to your character.\nYou have my sincerest gratitude, adventurer. I look forward to the day when I can repay your kindness with the proper payment."]

Well, I suppose that is as good a time as any to start wondering what she has been up to.\nShe is to be commended for her conspicuous absence this eve. Perhaps she has been spotted somewhere in the forest, but I cannot say for certain.\nIt is past time we resolved to assign her a more useful role, and I am pleased to say that her absence is no more inexplicable."]
