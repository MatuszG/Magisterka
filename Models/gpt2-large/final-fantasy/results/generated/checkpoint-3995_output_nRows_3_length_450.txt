Dialogue: ['\nRiridesu:', "\nI have been waiting for you, Forename.\nI am terribly sorry to have kept you waiting.\nPlease, take this as a token of my apology. It is my understanding that you are a man of great wealth. Please, allow me to ask you a question.\nI would like to know how you feel about playing an instrument. I suppose a wealth of knowledge about music is not something one can freely choose, is it?\nIf you feel you must answer in the negative, I ask that you try to imagine the feeling you would have if you were to play an instrument for an underprivileged child. Imagine the delight you would bring them if they were to sing your songs to the heavens.\nPlease allow me to ask again, but this time in the positive. I am sure you will find the answer enlightening.", '\nRiridesu:', '\nI am absolutely certain the answer you will give me will be of the utmost benefit to the child you are trying to aid. I am certain of it!', '\nRiridesu:', '\nWell, Forename, it appears I was not mistaken. You seem to genuinely enjoy the act of playing an instrument. I am certain this will prove to be a tremendous boon to the upbringing of future composers.']

Dialogue: ['\nElderlyprivate:', "\nYou there, sir. I believe I speak for all of us here when I say we need your help.\nI was out for an evening stroll and dropped my favorite harp in the river. I've been trying to recover it ever since, but it's no use.\nI'd wager it's somewhere in the mountains to the west of here, but I can't leave my home so easily.

Dialogue: ['\nKoko:', '\nHello again, traveler. I am sure you are eager to hear the details of my latest endeavor.\nAfter a lifetime of performing music in the shadows of the Empire, I have rediscovered my passion for music and am ready to share it with the people of Ul'dah.\nI am honored to be asked to play at the grand opening of the Ul'dah Philharmonic! I look forward to the delightfully dreary-sounding task of procuring the necessary materials to complete this monumental endeavor.\nNaturally, I could not hope to obtain these materials by myself, nor do I wish to. That is why I have asked my dear friend and fellow Ul'dahnian, Makoto of the Kohama Goldsmiths, to procure them for me.\nIf you are at all interested in learning more, pray speak with her.

Dialogue: ['\nElderlyprivate:', "\nSo, you're the one Forename mentioned. Well, I've got a task that wants a hard lad to handle.\nI've got a group of mercenaries I'm supposed to be training, and they're due back from their latest foray.\nBut I've got no idea where they went, or what they were doing, even after I asked them what the hell they were doing there in the first place.\nI'd go looking for them myself, but...well, I'm not much of a fighter. Even if I were, I wouldn't be able to get the job done.\nI don't know if you've heard, but there's a nunh of sorts down at Camp Drybone. One of her specialty is in kettledrum, a stringed instrument that she's been using to great effect to call down heavenly choirs.\nThe trouble is, none of the mercenaries I sent down there are of a strength to match.\nCould you get the kettledrum stringed for me? It's a simple thing, really. All you need is a couple of needle-sharpened lengths of old string.\nTake those lengths of string, and use a needle to snip a few of the holes on each end. Make sure you leave enough room for a prayer pot or something.\nGather up the kettledrums in that pot, and bury the ends in the dirt at the nunh's feet.\nThat should do the trick.\nWhen you've finished, bring the stringed instrument to me. I'll see that the mercenaries get it safely to their hands.", '\nElderlyprivate:', "\nI'm glad to see you returned safely. The kettledrum stringed for me?\nAh, this is just what I needed.\nI was at a loss for what to make the instrument look like.
