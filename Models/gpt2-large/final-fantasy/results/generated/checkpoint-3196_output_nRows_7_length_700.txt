Do you have the nectar?\nThank goodness! Thank goodness!\nThis is going to be the most money we ever spend on honeybees, all thanks to you! I'm sure you're wondering why we would entrust the bees with such a task, but let me explain─\nIt's a vital task for our species, ensuring the survival of our offspring. Each offspring is born with a unique set of traits.\nIf a population is to be continued, the traits of each individual must be maintained. If they're not, then the population will decline.\nThere's naught for us to worry our dear bees about─the future is in our hands. In fact, it's our responsibility as a species to provide it.\nWe can't continue to rely on outside help, though. If we don't have the bees to pollinate the flowers, we're doomed to fade from existence.\nThat's why I'm so determined to make this place work. I want to make this place bloom, and I want to make sure my little bees have a chance.\nIf we don't, then I fear they'll only be able to see their offspring for the next generation.\nI know it's a long way to go, but I promise to make this place work─no matter what. Thank you for helping make my dream come true."]

Dialogue: ['\nWanderingminstrel:', "\nA wondrous instrument, indeed─a gift from the gods themselves, gifted to our mortal ancestors. Their craftsmanship is unparalleled, and this particular piece is worth a great deal of gil.\nBut how do I know? I have seen it with my own eyes, in the flesh. I was there, in the Coliseum, when the fiends fell upon the champions of Limsa.\nI cannot claim to have witnessed the champions completely destroyed, but I do believe I saw most of them stripped to their core. Pieces from their cores still glisten on the sands, as if awaiting the end of days.\nWhile it is a wonder that they could so calmly dismantle their foes, it also raises a question: why did they do it?\nThere can be only one explanation─the champions were performing a sacred ritual. Pieces from the cores of ancient enemy gods were stored in the Coliseum, and they would surely have been resold had they found their way into the wrong hands.\nIt is, in fact, this very ritual which earned the minstrel his gift. In order to pass on their knowledge to future generations, the gods gave these instruments their names.\nCovetous to the core, they are, but they also know that preserving the memories of our ancestors is paramount. Thus did they imbue these objects with as much sacred power as they could.\nThe instruments are, in fact, treasured objects in their own right. They are not just decorative objects, but also vital to our way of life. They are essential to our well-being, and must be protected.\nAnd so I ask you, Forename: will you collect three cores from the ancient enemy gods, and place them in these wooden boxes? I will make it worth your while.", '\nPop:', '\nThe ancient enemy gods begin to stir!', '\nWanderingminstrel:', '\nAh, you have returned! Please, I need your help.

But the gods only answered in the form of a warning─to forsake one's friends, one must look upon them with a different eye.\nThe man in question, it would seem, was a lancer, one of the finest of our order. When the Azure Dragoon questioned him about his intentions, the man confessed that he wished to lay waste to Quicksand, that he wished to make it a desolate wasteland and call it a death sentence.\nBut the Azure Dragoon scoffed at such a notion, and told the lancer that he must abandon his cause and return home.\nThe lancer, it seems, was taken aback by the answer, and began to cry. But the Azure Dragoon, seeing the hand that was extending him comfort, stood up straight and faced the man.\nThere, my friend, was the wisdom of a thousand years. The lancer stood there for a moment, then looked out upon the landscape, and saw the rose blooming there. And there, in the shadow of that rose, was the hero of Azys Lla.\nThe lancer then quietly faded from our sight, and the Azure Dragoon stood there, looking at that rose with a different eye.\nMy friend, as you can see, is not of our time─nor of our place in this world. Yet, in our time, he was blessed with an understanding that transcends time and place, and has ever been happy to impart that knowledge to others.\nHe would grant you wisdom if you would hear him out.

For years, the two of us have bickered over who would rule in the wake of the Calamity─until, that is, you came along.\nIn fact, it would seem we have grown so accustomed to each other that we are now unable to separate our roles as stalwarts of the Resistance and our loyal friends in the Eorzean Alliance.\nBut forgive me for being a hopeless idealist, Forename. I believe there is still time to win over the hearts of my countrymen. I just need you to tell me of a struggle they would be willing to endure to the bitter end─a struggle that would test even the bravest of us.\nAye, I speak of the Dravanian War─a war that has claimed the lives of untold numbers of our people, yet which continues to this day to divide our people along the disputed border.\nI have long struggled to understand why so many of my countrymen feel so alienated from the other side.

I would ask you to deliver this resolution to Eorzea, to the effect that we the Resistance seek a peaceful resolution to our dispute with the Empire.\nThe resolution is as follows:\nThe House of Splendors declares that it renounces all military action and cooperation with the Empire; that it declares that the Resistance is the sole representative of the people of the Resistance; and that it declares its intention to abide by the Resolutive.\nUnder these circumstances, it is understood that the resolution will not be easily accepted by our allies in the Alliance.\nHowever, should our efforts be in vain, we should endeavor to put the issue to rest by demonstrating our unity.
