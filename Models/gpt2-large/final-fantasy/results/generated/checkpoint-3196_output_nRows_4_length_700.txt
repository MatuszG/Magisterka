It reminds me of a children's game.\nYou see, the objective of the game is to pick three colors─red, green, and yellow─and name them. The players must do this in such a way that it resembles a flower.\nIt was devised by researchers at the Crystarium, but it is played entirely by children.\nIt is quite popular, and they recently made a game in cooperation with the Adventurers' Guild. The rules of the game are not readily apparent, but I have been given instructions to instruct you as to how to play.\nShould you desire a more challenging game, you might also consider joining a guild.\nOh, and if you have a moment to spare, I would greatly appreciate it if you could introduce me to your fellow researchers.']

But all is not yet lost─I can think of a way to ensure that he receives the necessary support.\nIf you are willing, please make haste to our Research and Development Facility in Ul'dah, where you can speak with our researchers. We would be grateful if you could lend a hand in finding a solution to his problems.', '\nBibimu:', '\nSo, you have been busy. Very busy indeed.\nI am told that you have been quite busy.

He's been living out of a tent for the past two years.\nHe's been trying to make sense of it all, but to no avail. He's been drifting in and out of consciousness, unable to remember much of what's happened to him.\nBut I've been thinking of him, and I think it's important for me to know.

It was during a visit to the New Nest that I heard tell of a man named Yon bard, who was recently laid to rest.\nMy heart aches to even imagine the man's passing, but I would be forever in his debt if you would spare a moment to hear his tale.\nIn the days before the Flood, the Blessed used the nectar from the Lady of Bliss to draw birds to their nests. Yon bard, being a man of few words, was unable to properly thank you for his service.\nHis widow, on the other hand, was more than pleased to receive the nectar in question. And so, the cycle of nectar-giving and flower-waving continued.\nThus, as a token of their gratitude, the Blessed placed a wreath in front of their house, where a young elven girl once lived. The wreath, as you can see, was made of the purest gold, and was said to remind the child of their mother's beauty.\nYou will doubtless be surprised by what you have learned of this man, but I am certain that hearing his story will help you to see the world in a new light.
