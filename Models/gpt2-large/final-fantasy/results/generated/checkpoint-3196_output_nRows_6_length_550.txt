I don't doubt that they've got their reasons for keeping the place secure, but to keep it secret while allowing their criminal activities to go unchecked is another matter.\nI suppose I can't really fault them for doing so. It's just that the cave is not the sort of place an adventurer would normally set foot in.\nBut I can't blame them for trying to keep their operations hidden, can I? It's the law.\nIf they want to keep their hide, they'll have to keep it secret no more. I'm sure that's what they wanted you to find, adventurer.\nSo, what do you think?
