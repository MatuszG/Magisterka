If you have a moment, I would be at your disposal. There is a man by the name of Jobst who you may be well acquainted with. He is an old friend of mine, and an authority on the black markets. The man has recently been approached by a man who claims to be a representative of the Crystarium Trading Company. The man offered Jobst a wide variety of wares, all of which Jobst declined. Jobst informed the man that he was only interested in rare and precious items, and that he should be expected at the Hotels of the Platinum Mirage. The man left without providing any reason for his absence, and Jobst has been left with no choice but to turn the offer down. Jobst has not been idle since the incident, and so I would ask that you search his belongings for anything of interest. I realize that this may seem like a trivial matter, but it would be a great help in uncovering the truth of the matter if you could recover any evidence of the deal.

The Hotels of the Platinum Mirage are meant to be the last resort, and we don't want to be held responsible for any crimes our patrons might commit. Please recover the stolen goods from Jobst's possessions.", '\nTaina:', "I have received word from Jobst. He claims the offer he was offered was too good to refuse. Jobst has not commented on the matter, but I imagine the situation must have been dire enough to make him change his mind. At any rate, your investigation has led you to a man who may be able to shed some light on the matter. You may have noticed, but I have a man by the name of Kallimelios at my side. He is an old friend of Jobst, and an authority on the black markets. Kallimelios has been tasked with facilitating the exchange of rare and precious items for Horizon Security.

But if it's all I can do to keep the bees happy, well... I've got no choice.\nI've got a plan, you hear me? A little beekeeping, a little beautifying, a whole lot of naught but good.\nThe plan is simple: cover more ground with honeybees, and make more honey.\nThe bees love nectar from flowers, and flying nectar is what gets them buzzing. Cover more ground, and you've got a fighting chance of getting some.\nThe flowers are hard to find, so you'll have to do the work. I'll leave the nectar to you, and you can make the bees happy.\nOf course, you'll have to take care of the bees. They may not be happy if you're stung, so make sure they get a good beekeeping lesson.\nGo to Titania and tell her what you plan to do, and she'll give you a little something to make the bees happy.\nOf course, you'll have to take care of the bees.

Here, I shall tell you of his final destination.\nUpon arriving in the seaside village where I met with the fisherman, he threw himself into the waters and was lost to sight for a time.\nFrightened by his own reflection in the water, he began to cry.

He fashioned a rod out of a dried fish he had caught, and with the help of a goldsmith, he fashioned a special axe with which he could fight.\nWhen the villagers saw the axe in action, they were awestruck. The elementals confirmed his identity when they delivered him into our world.\nHe was raised by a tribe of nomads until he was able to find his calling in life. Here, I shall tell you of his final destination.\nUpon returning home, the fisherman chose to rest in a place that he himself had called home.

Fearing that his grief would be burdensome to his children, the elementals took away his rod, and he was unable to make his way back to his home.\nFearing for his children's future, the fisherman turned to a friend and made a vow to preserve the rod he had made. In exchange for his life, the friend would provide him with the tools he needed to continue his work.\nThe friend would be destroyed in the Calamity, however. Unable to bear the loss of his work, the fisherman left his home and came to us.\nWith the help of a goldsmith, the fisherman was able to reclaim his rod and set forth on his travels once more.\nThere is much more I could tell you of his final destination, but I have already run out of small talk.

We would often lie in wait whilst our father sent others to hunt our prey, only to return to gorge on our own tail.\nIn order to teach us the proper technique, he gifted us with an iron lute.

It is not the case. You will become a better hunter simply by knowing how to use it.\nNow then, we ought to practice swinging the lute so that it becomes as natural to us as swinging a stick.\nAh, you need not concern yourself with where I am going to take you.

At any rate, it is time to swing the lute.\nAh, the sound of the wind as you swing it makes for a lovely melody. You are clearly quite skilled at handling an iron lute.\nNow, do not be too distracted by the fact that I am holding the lute. This is a lesson you will need to learn the next time you go hunting.\nNow, you are doubtless wondering what we will be playing this time. We will be playing a sacred song. It is said that, “the lute is a vessel of silence, “and its mere existence allows one to carry out sacred deeds.\nWe will be singing of the creation of man, the heavens, and our dear, dear Doma. The song tells the story of how man was given his life, and the journey he has chosen to make.\nWhen our father gifted us our lute, he chose to teach us its history. It is our way that we remember him, and it is for this reason we chose to honor him with a sacred dance.\nWhen we first began playing the lute, it was a mere instrument. But now, it is something that embraces all of us, from the youngest child to the oldest. It is a shared treasure that we treasure together, and I am sure that you will find it equally rewarding to learn it.\nNow, I would like you to take the first piece of our gift. It is a piece of the sacred song, Doma. It is meant to guide you on your journey.\nLet us begin with the verse, “Through endless dreams,Through endless sorrow,Doma triumphs.” Ah, it is as beautiful a melody as I have ever heard.\nYou should feel honored to be able to hear the words of our song with your own ears. It is sung in remembrance of your father, and it is said that, “he who bears the Doma name has transcended the bounds of time and space.”\nI wonder if my sisters have heard the song before you, but I am sure they will be thrilled to hear it together.\nAfter you have learned the verse, I am sure you will want to practice swinging the lute.

The creatures which roam near the Blessed are not to be trifled with, and I am not like to leave my post to go hunting for myself.\nI would be grateful if you could fetch me one of their horns.\nPlease, you must recover my mare's horn. Please, you must retrieve my mare from the beasts which stalk her. Please, you must not let her be lost to the wolves.', '\nGodbert:', '\nMy thanks, friend. Your horn is as white as a princess's paps.\nYou have done me a great service today, and I would be eternally grateful if you could keep it to yourself.\nI have not the disposition to hunt, much less put down my own countrymen. But one must not let this opportunity slip by. I will make myself useful, you see─by helping you hunt the beasts which prey on our mares.']

Dialogue: ['\nFufucha:', "Ah, Forename. It's good of you to come. I was just finishing up some of the tasks that Master Ququruka assigned me.\nThere's one more that I would have you learn. It concerns the use of materia.\nBefore long, I'll teach you how to use materia. But before that, I want you to practice using it.\nGo to the storage chest just outside the west gate and retrieve four pieces of materia. When you're done, present the pieces to me.\n", '\nFufucha:', "Go to the storage chest just outside the west gate and retrieve four pieces of materia. When you're done, present the pieces to me.\nNow, you might be wondering how you can acquire materia if you haven't actually used it. The answer is this: when you use an item to cast a spell, a certain substance is released that attracts an aetherial energy.\nWhen you have enough of that energy, you can use the piece of materia to summon a more powerful incarnation of that spell.\nMaster Ququruka designed the materia so that it could be used to cast a wide variety of spells. As such, it is easily recognizable by its shape.\nNow, when I teach you how to use materia, you'll no doubt want to memorize the spells that it allows you to cast.\nGo on, then. Practice your spells. When you've mastered four of them, present the pieces to me.\nGo on, then. Practice your spells. When you've mastered four of them, present the pieces to me.\nAh, you're ready! Pray allow me to demonstrate the various techniques you'll be using with your new materia.\nNow, before I can teach you the various techniques I use with my materia, I need you to put it to use.\nGo on, then. Cast a spell and present the piece of materia to me. I'll show you how to use it in the next lesson.\nAh, you're still staring at the piece of materia in your hands. I'm sure you're wondering what I'd like you to do with it. Well, since you can't use the spell directly, I'd like you to cast it into the aetherial energy that surrounds you.\nSince the spell you cast into the aetherial energy surrounds you, you'll be able to use it to summon stronger spells. As before, present the pieces of materia to me for demonstration.\n"]

Dialogue: ['\nSorocan:', "You have the pleasure of speaking with a friend of mine. Her name is Sorocan, and she is an accomplished musician as well.\nI was hoping to ask her to share some of the minutiae of her life, but she is so busy that she has been unable to spare a moment.\nIf you could find her a seat near the entrance to the Thalassai and listen to her perform, I would be forever in your debt.", '\nSorocan:', "Welcome back. I hope she did not forget to mention the fine instruments we once shared...\nNow, before we begin, I must confess that I never dreamed of owning an udgan.\nI learned of them from my father, a traveling merchant who often stopped by my shop. He would often play us songs in honor of our happy customers.\nWhen I was young, I dreamed of owning an udgan, but I never had the chance.\nThen, one day, I stumbled across a postcard depicting an artist's rendition of an instrument we once used. I instantly knew what it must be like to have an instrument you once loved, and I immediately set about making my own.\nAfter some trial and error, I eventually settled on a design that I felt was most like an udgan. It is a simple but elegant design, and I think it would be perfect for playing along with my favorite song.\nThe final touch was to incorporate a bone pickaxe, a relic from a time when the Doman people used their bone to craft blades for their blades.\nIt is no exaggeration to say that the pickaxe is one of my all-time favorites. It brings back so many memories, and I hope you will be able to use it as inspiration for your own creation.\nWhen I first set about making my udgan, I had no idea I would end up sharing so many of my memories with you. It has been a great comfort knowing that you can find inspiration from your own life, friend."]

Title: A Blissful Arrival
Dialogue: ['\nTutusi:', '\nA pleasure to see you, Forename. There is something that I would ask of you.\nIn my village, we often serve hot meals to our guests. Our cooking is excellent, and our guests are always delighted.\nBut recently, our supply of meats has been wanting. We could not possibly keep up with demand, so every guest is now provided with a choice of meats─beef, lamb, or fish.\nUnfortunately, none of these options are particularly appealing. The meat from the beasts of the sea is a particularly tough and dry product, and the seafood is of a poor quality.\nI would be most grateful if you could procure the meats in my stead. You will find them in the water to the west of here, just as before.\n', '\nTutusi:', '\nPlease bring me the meats in my stead. You will find them in the water to the west of here, just as before.', '\nTutusi:', '\nHave you brought the meats?\nExcellent! My guests will be delighted!\n<sigh> Of course, they are not entirely without choice. There is nothing to be gained from depriving them of meat─especially when there is so much here that they could likely cook it themselves.\nBut what is a man to do? My village is in great need, and if I do not fulfill my role then who will? I am loath to ask this of you, but might you speak with the other villagers and see what they would prefer?', '\nAlisaie:', '\nMy thanks, Alisaie. I know that our guests may not be aware of the change in the sea, but I assure them it is nothing short of a blessing.\nWe used to prepare meat using the skin of fish and shellfish, but now we have chosen to use live marine creatures for our main source of meat. This way, we can be certain that the meat is of the highest quality and that our guests will not be dissatisfied.\nI have already prepared the broth for our guests, and would have you take it to the others─Tutusi, in particular. He should be able to choose from the meats as well.', '\nTutusi:', '\nAh, Forename. I trust you have the meats?\nWonderful! My guests will enjoy these as well!\nDo be mindful to tell the others that the broth you prepared is not for them. For them, this is merely a repast to warm their hearts. For you, it is a savory treat that will warm both body and soul.', '\nAlisaie:', '\nMy thanks, Alisaie.

My guests were waiting for you─and me, I suppose.\nIt is past time that I offered my gratitude to you, as well. Here is a small token of my appreciation.']

Dialogue: ['\nAveril:', "Oh, you're the visitor everyone's been talking about! I've just the thing for you!\nJust the other day, this old merchant from Ul'dah, who's been visiting us for a bit, asked me if I'd be willing to help out with something. I thought nothing of it at the time, but I've just received word from my friend in Reunion who says he has a task very suited to one such as yourself!\nIf you're interested in hearing more, you could do a lot worse than speaking with my friend in Reunion. He can tell you all about it!", '\nOld Merchant:', "Ah, Forename Surname. A pleasure. I have a task that could be made especially suited to one of your abilities.\nIt's nothing fancy, but I've prepared some smoked fish for the refugees to take with them when they arrive in Reunion.\nThe smoked fish you see behind me are the smoked fish the Garleans brought with them from Castrum Abania. They were meant to serve as a deterrent against the Sahagin, but they've gotten a bit muddled in their current state.\nIf you could take these and place them along the shore in front of the tents, it would make it much easier for them to spot us coming and going.\nBring some smoked fish back here when you're done.", '\nOld Merchant:', "Welcome back. I trust you've brought the smoked fish?\nThank you, my friend! I think the Garleans made off with half of them already!\nThe other half, I believe you've brought back. I'm sure they haven't been able to finish setting up their tent yet.\nOh, and here's your payment. I hope you didn't forget about that."]
