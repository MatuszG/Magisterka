Title: A Brave Resolution
Dialogue: ['\nPrairillot:', 'Ah, Forename─the other day you came to deliver the amethysts. I was hoping to speak with you regarding the resolution of the conundrum.\nWe have had a council of the Twelve, and passed a resolution recommending that the sylphs be granted official status.\nThis follows the precedent set in the sylphic accord of the Twelve years ago.\nThe sylphs were accorded a degree of respect and courtesy by the other races of Gridania. The sylphs were even accorded official status by the sylphic nations of Ul'dah and the trilobite tribes.\nThe sylphs have long been concerned with their own future. The sylphic nations have long sought to diversify their territory and preserve their distinct identity.\nTo this end, they have established a number of systems designed to encourage immigration.\nFor example, the sylphs have established a residential district known as the “Resistance Camp.” This residential district is administered by the sylphs themselves, and is designed to encourage immigration.\nThe sylphs also established a “consultative body” known as the “Consultative Council.” This body, in turn, coordinates immigration efforts among the various sylph tribes.\nAll of these systems were put in place to encourage immigration, but they also serve a dual purpose─they also serve to preserve the distinct identity of the sylphs.\nThe sylphic nations are constantly in need of new

Dialogue: ['\nHamon:', "\nWe've come far since last we met. As a sign of our gratitude, here's a letter of introduction from Wlveva.\nAnd as a token of our gratitude, here's a portrait of Wlveva in her youth.\nAs you might expect, the elder gods have a penchant for keeping their creations under wraps. This is in part because they're too valuable to destroy, but also because they're too precious to reveal to mortals.\nBut that all changes now─and only through mutual respect and understanding can we hope to honor their wishes.\nSo please, take this portrait with your own, and let others know that Wlveva means business. I'll be around to greet you when you've finished.", '\nPop:', '\nYou sense a hostile presence!', '\nHamon:', "\nWelcome back, Forename. I trust you've had a chance to freshen up?\nI take it you've seen to the portrait, then?\nAnd Wlveva? What have you learned of her?\n...I see. I can hardly imagine what her intentions are, but I do hope that this knowledge brings her closer to her heart's desire.\nShe is truly a remarkable woman. A true artist in her own right.\nAnd yet, she is held in such esteem by her peers that she feels the need to keep hidden her true identity?\nThe elder gods surely know this. They surely know that she would never allow her art to be destroyed.\nBut that is not to say that she

Well done, Forename.\nWith this, we can finally move on to the final stage of the plan.\nEorzea will be pitted against the Empire once more, and we need every weapon we can muster.\nI would ask you to collect the adamantium ore cluster from the giant tree at Fallgourd Float.

Dialogue: ['\nTataru:', '\nWell, it seems that our noble efforts have been for naught.\nAfter all, the Crystal Braves are still nothing more than a band of misfits, and their leader is a crazed heretic.\nIt's high time we gave him a piece of our mind!\nHe has tried to seize the Crystarium for his own, but we've stood in his way, and now we have an ally in the House of Commons! I mean to make our mark as a neutral party, and I need you to speak with my fellow rebels.\nThe House of Commons is composed of representatives of the citizenry, chosen by the House of Commons to represent their interests. Each representative is free to choose their own topic of discussion, but I think you'll find it enlightening─and possibly inspiring─to hear your fellow man's concerns and ideas.\nYou should speak with my fellow rebels once more to get a better idea of what it means to be an outsider in Ishgard.

Dialogue: ['\nResistance Councilor:', "Aye, I heard you and your men were quite effective in holding the Empire at bay for a time.\nThough we may have lost the battle for Castrum Centri, our victory was not entirely one-sided. Many of our allies chose to remain on the field and fight in the war effort.\nIt was an important step in demonstrating the Resistance's determination to stand against the Empire, and it was hoped that such victories would convince the Garleans that they must abandon the occupation of Eorzea.\nUnfortunately, it seems our efforts to win over those who remained behind were met with stiff resistance.\nIt shames me to ask this after we had made such valiant efforts, but─to the best of my knowledge─none of the Resistance leaders or their aides have been arrested.\nIt is my hope that this information will convince them to come home, but I know that it will take time.\nI ask that you convey my thanks to any leaders or aides you might have met who have decided to remain on the front line. I shall continue to keep my eyes and ears open for developments."]
