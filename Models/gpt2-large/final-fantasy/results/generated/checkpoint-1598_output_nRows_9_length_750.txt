Dialogue: ['\nJantellot:', "\nAh, Forename. I was hoping you might be coming by. I've a rather interesting report for you.\nIt concerns the beekeeping of the local population, you see. You see, my research into the flora and fauna of the surrounding area has led me to believe that the bees' natural defenses are quite effective.\nAnd so I propose that we set up a permanent observation post, in which to observe and record the creatures in action.\nThe bees in question are of the genus Apis, and I've observed them fly towards and around the observation post, at a distance of several paces.\nIt would seem they are drawn to the scent of nectar, and will not hesitate to strike if they sense their danger.\nI believe you are familiar with the term “buzzard swarm,” I believe you are. I have also observed them flying towards the observation post.\nTo compound matters, they are rather fond of honeybees. As such, I have no doubt that they will swarm the observation post in a panic should you approach them.\nI think you will find them rather disorganized, so I would suggest you approach them one at a time, and see if they are uncooperative.\nI see, that was rather a lengthy report. I only hope you're not too distracted by the buzzing of the bees to get lost in your inquiries. I shall see to it you are rewarded for your work.", '\nJantellot:', '\nYou have returned. Very good.\nI trust you have taken a liking to the bees? I had no idea they were so fond of honeybees.\nThe bees' behavior toward us is of grave concern, I fear.\nTheir numbers have been on the rise, and I fear that they will soon overwhelm our already stretched resources.\nI shall have to make preparations for the worst. Thank you for your help, and may your beekeeping efforts bring you great wealth in the future.']

I heard you were in attendance at the banquet, and I fear I must have missed the opportunity.\nWhen the Admiral requested that you join him, I feared that you would be the only person who could make a difference─that the task would be too big, too dangerous, and too difficult to handle by yourself.\nInstead, you have proved yourself capable, and I have no doubt that you will do the same for me in the future.\nI hope that you will not only be joining us─that you will be participating in the banquet as well. I would not have you join us if I did not think you capable, so I would ask you to join me in the banquet.\nIt is not my place to ask you to participate in the banquet─that is your prerogative. The task you have been given is of a very personal nature, and you will need your own strength to carry it out.\nYou will need to travel to the location indicated on the map, and there you will encounter the wyrm Nidhogg.
