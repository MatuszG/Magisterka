I thought I was done for.\nBut then I heard a voice─a voice that sounded quite like me! It was a familiar─a familiar with a certain melody, I think it was called.\nI can't quite recall the tune, but I do remember it... It was the theme from an old song.\nYou know, I was hoping that I might meet you─someone who has an instrument like this. If you could give it to me, that would be all the more reason to let me try!", '\nMimiomio:', "\nI've heard of your beloved instrument, Forename. It seems I was mistaken.\nI know not where it came from, but I imagine it was gifted to you by your fellow warriors.\nI can't believe that I didn't think to ask before.

Dialogue: ['\nMogzun:', "\nI must thank you for saving my life. I had been living a life of crime and despair.\nMy father was a drunkard, so I went to him and begged for his help. He promised to help me, but the day I came back I found my father dead. I was too ashamed to ask for his body, so I took it to the graveyard.\nAs I was searching for my father's body, I stumbled across the body of my own mother. She had been killed by an angry mob. I couldn't believe it myself, but I knew she was innocent.

I never want to see her again, so I ask you to search for her and see if she is still alive.", '\nMogzun:', "\nI will not take my mother's death lightly.

I was hoping to get a word from you about the work I've been asked to perform.\nAye, I'm supposed to be delivering a song to an honored guest. It's not my finest work, but I believe it's the only one of its kind.\nIt's a tale of love and sacrifice, of betrayal and forgiveness, all told with the utmost sensitivity.\nIt's not meant for an audience of mortals, I understand, but the song's meant for the realm's finest knights. If you're willing to give it a try, I should be happy to pay for it.\nYou'll find the gentleman in question at the Ruby Road Exchange. My apologies for the wait─I've been tasked with facilitating trade between Dravanian and Garleans.\nI should hope you'll have an appetite for the song, though. I know it's not the most elegant of poems, but I'll not deny that it's quite moving.", '\nBenedict:',
