But it is nevertheless a truer rendition of a raptor's claw.\nWe often use raptors for our drills, you see. This staff is perfect for teaching our younger chancers how to wield raptors.\nThe raptor's bone is prized by the Order of Nald'thal, so I imagine that you would not be surprised to learn that it is quite common in the region.\nYou can also expect to find raptor bones in abundance in the area, though I imagine you will also encounter them more often. Please do not hesitate to seek out these beasts in the future.']
