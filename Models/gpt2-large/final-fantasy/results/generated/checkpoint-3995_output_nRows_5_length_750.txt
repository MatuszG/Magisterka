I am Gibrillont, a chirurgeon who specialises in the treatment of the wounded.\nIn my time, I have seen men brought to their graves with nothing but their last breaths left to speak of. But days, weeks, or even years after they are gone...they begin to speak of their lives.\nWarbling is an art, and like all true artists it requires time and patience. But I can only help so much. I would be most grateful if you could recite for me three verses of praise for your valiant efforts.\nI can only hope that your singing will be able to bring the fallen to their graves...and that the verses can serve as a source of solace for their loved ones.\nI'll begin with the straightforward. You have sung of the passing of a friend. Have you also sung of the journey they took to reach us?\nAh, yes...a journey to find the one who would take their place alongside Haldrath, Forename. That is well and good, but what of the man who would take their place beside Haldrath?\nAh, yes...the Antecedent. Though you may have only met him once, there is no mistake: he was a great hero. A true warrior who would go to war even if he had to fight alone. A testament to the fact that true heroism can come in many forms.\nHe was born into a noble family, but grew to despise wealth and power. To this day, he lives a simple life in the village and is rarely seen in the city.\nWhen he heard the news of the Battle of Carteneau, however, all of a sudden he felt a stirring within him. He felt as if he could no longer stand by and watch as things happened around him─as if he could take action himself. And so he journeyed to the front, where he fell in battle alongside Haldrath.\nNot a day goes by that I do not think of him, nor the man he was beside him. It has been some time since I last heard his voice, but I pray that he is still with us...at least in a better place.\nSo you see, warbling is not a mere performance. It is a way of letting the dead know they are not forgotten. It may not mean much on its own, but together we can make a difference.\nI must warn you, however, that this method of remembrance can be difficult for outsiders to understand. We must speak in plain words and not take ourselves too seriously.\nBut I see now that it is for naught if we fail to show our respect for the fallen. For as the saying goes, for each life we save, we save a life we never knew. So it is that I continue to strive to improve my art.\nAnd one day, I hope to be able to perform at the funeral of one who has truly made the world a better place. One who I've been told will be joining me at the ceremony are the two heroes from Eorzea: the Azure Dragoon and his comrade from Gridania, Ser Aymeric.\nI cannot wait to hear their stories, and to share my art with them.

He comes to the Cry when he has found a target he can capture with the dragoon's blade.\nIshgardian knights and dragoons both wear white, and that's probably why the dragoon chose that particular garb. It's not as if he saw a target other than himself in that mask, mind you!\nHe is of course, an Azure Dragoon. But that doesn't mean he looks the same─not by a long shot!\nAs you can see, his armor is of impeccable quality. He might look the part of a drifter, but his mind is sharp and inquiring. He would make a fine dragooon!"]

It will be your task to keep the peace in the region.\nAh, but before you can carry out your new duties, you will need to take a physical. Report to Sandre at the inn and he will see you set to work.", '\nSandre:', "\nSo you wish to join the Grand Company. I suppose it's time you got down to business.\nWell, this is a pleasant surprise. I had been expecting a contingent of soldiers from the North Shroud to come to join the rest of the garrison, but I had no idea it would be you and your fellow Loporrits.\nI had a mind to assign you to a squad, but I've received word that a more senior officer had a change of heart.\nHe has asked that you join him in the field. If that isn't enough to get your juices flowing, I've been given permission to release you into the wider world.\nIf you'd like to give the matter some thought, speak with my commanding officer. He's certain to be more than a little pleased to have a grunt like you on his side.", '\nBrawny Loporrit:', '\nThe people of Etheirys will be glad to have a champion like you in the fight against the poachers. I must give you your proper training, yes?', '\nBrawny Loporrit:', "\nYes, training is fine by me! You've made a fine soldier, and I'm pleased to have you under my command.\nBut I would be lying if I said more training wasn't part of the decision.\nIt is only a matter of time until the poachers are no more.

Dialogue: ['\nJubkhal:', "\nYou're the traveler who helped save Mehvan's life, yes? I've a task that needs a brave soul like you to deliver it.\nOne of the stone guardians in the ruins, it...it attacked my companions and me.\nI need you to slay three of the creatures, and bring me back their cores. That's all. I won't be needing your help after that.\nHere, take these cores, and make sure to bring me their cores. I won't be needing your help after that.", '\nJubkhal:', '\nI can't thank you enough. You were our only hope.\nNow, let us return to Mehvan and ensure that he is safe. Please, be careful.', '\nMehvan:', '\nI have heard the tales, but to see you in my stead is a great comfort.\nWelcome back, traveler. What did you face?\n...A jagged boulder, you say?\nI see... I shall have to rest a while longer before I can face the task of slaying these abominations. Thanks to you, I am one step closer to fulfilling my destiny.']

Dialogue: ['\nVarthon:', "\nAs I live and breathe, Blade Surname! It's an honor, sir.\nMy name is Varthon, researcher and curator of ancient Bozjan artifacts. I have been working to recreate the attire and arms of our ancestors, and if you might humor me, I believe we both stand to benefit from a little mutual cooperation...\nAt great personal risk, I have braved the battlefield to explore what ruins I could find for relics, but circumstances have changed in recent days.\nSomething has drawn the IVth Legion's attention to the ruins, and they've been searching, excavating for something. Whatever it is, I cannot continue my work so long as they linger about the place.\nBut you have spent your fair share behind enemy lines, have you not? I would be ever so grateful if you could bring back any relics you find on your next foray.\nWith but a few of these artifacts, I am quite confident I can recreate the arms of our ancestors, and I promise to make it worth your while.", '\nVarthon:', '\nGood to see you, Blade Surname. My research proceeds apace thanks in no small part to your contributions.\nThough I would be lying if I said more relics would not hasten my progress.\nMight I prevail upon you to recover more artifacts? Naturally, anything irrelevant to my work is yours to keep.', '\nVarthon:', '\nThank you again for your help, Blade Surname. I very much look forward to seeing what relics you might procure.', '\nVarthon:', "\nWere you able to find anything out there?\nMy, what an extraordinary find! Master Gerolt will no doubt be excited to examine this as well.\nAnd what have we here...? Why, this appears to be some sort of currency!\nA valuable find to be sure, but alas, my work has no use for it. I think it only fair that you keep it, Blade Surname. Perhaps you can find some use for it.\nAs agreed, you may do with it as you will. I look forward to working with you again."]

Dialogue: ['\nNimie:', "I can't see as how I oughta care, but Commander Handeloup of the Maelstrom's sentinels seems awfully fond o' you. Why don't you go on an errand for him in the barracks? It's not far─Slafborn's got a nice hall for you and a dozen or so retinues besides.", '\nHandeloup:', "Welcome back, my friend. I trust you enjoyed your visit to the Barracks?\nConsidering the situation we're in, I daresay that our men would benefit from a little rest and recuperation.\nYou are well aware that our command structure is stretched to its breaking point, right? That is why each and every one of our men is expected to carry out his or her assigned mission on the battlefield.\nYou are also well aware that the mere mention of civilian casualties can trigger a wave of panic, which can have a direct impact on our ability to effectively carry out our duties. Needless to say, we cannot have men dying on our watch.\nSo I ask you: what would you say to joining the rest of our garrison in the training grounds? You would surely be aware that civilian casualties can have a direct impact on our ability to effectively carry out our duties, would you not agree?\nNaturally, I would not ask you to commit to a single mission─that is, of course, your decision to make. But should you have the opportunity to expand your horizons─to broaden your horizon─I would of course welcome you as a full-fledged member of the Maelstrom.", '\nNimie:', "You said you were interested in joining the rest o' our garrison?\nConsidering the situation we're in, I daresay that our men would benefit from a little rest and recuperation.
