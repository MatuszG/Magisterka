I'll see you at the gates, then.", '\nGigi:', "I've heard you're not afraid to get your hands dirty.

I have a favor to ask if you are willing.\nI was planning to have a look at the weapons and armor on display, but I fear I'll be late for it.\nI have a feeling the weapons and armor were intended for the Empire's military, so I thought I'd ask around the local market.\nI was hoping you'd be willing to help out, would you? If you're willing, I'll pay you for the work.\nI'll need you to go to the market and ask around, and see if anyone knows of a suitable place to buy some imperial equipment.\nYou'll find the market is quite busy, so you may need to wait a while.
