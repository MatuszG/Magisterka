Take it, and good luck!"]

I was hoping you would come along.\nWe are currently negotiating a trade agreement with the Vundu.\nWe have made great strides in opening new markets and strengthening our cooperation, but there is still much to be done before we can truly realize our potential.\nI worry that if I do not give this initiative the necessary attention, our efforts will be for naught.\nAs you are familiar with the Vundu, I am sure you realize that they are a people with a rich heritage and culture. As such, it is my hope that they will offer us their support should we pursue our goals.\nThe Vundu have long been an ally of our House of Splendors, and have long been a major contributor to the restoration of Ala Mhigo.\nHowever, recent events have made it clear that they are no longer welcome in their former territories.\nI would like nothing more than to engage in talks with the Vundu directly, but I fear I am ill equipped to do so.\nThat is where you come in. As our representative from House of Splendors, you are well versed in the finer points of statecraft, so perhaps you would be able to persuade the Vundu to take up our cause.\nI realize that this will require a delicate balancing act, but I would be forever in your debt if you could speak with the Vundu in my stead.\nSpeak with Xolani, the leader of the Vundu in Ok' Zundu. Show her my letter, and seek her out whenever you have a spare moment. I will be watching.\nI am certain you already know this, but the Vundu are an indigenous people. They were originally brought here as livestock for the purpose of agriculture, but they have since developed a rich variety of flora and fauna that are unique to their region.\nTheir unique way of life, however, means that they are not easily receptive to outside influence.\nTheir leader, Xolani, is an old acquaintance of mine. I think you will find her to be an equally unfriendly individual. Do be careful when attempting to approach her. \nLastly, make sure you do not speak with any other local leaders. Neglecting your duties, or worse, could result in you receiving a less than warm reception.\n', '\nXolani:', '\nUgh...\n<sigh> I am loath to trouble you with such a trivial matter, but could I trouble you for a moment?\nA letter? From Urianger?

In fact, the very name itself means “House of Splendors,” in honor of our founder, Severian.\nBut, as we have recently seen, the Empire has taken an even more active role in reclaiming our nation.\nWe have been approached by representatives of their government, as well as foreign armies.\nWe have been told to expect an onslaught of invaders. If we do not strengthen our defenses now, we will not be able to withstand them in the future.\nI am loath to send you to the front lines, however, and would ask you to remain here until such

As a first step, I've been examining the wain.\nBased on what I've learned, it seems that some manner of crystal was used to create the false reality that surrounds the ship.\nWhile I cannot say for certain what purpose, one thing is certain─the Wood Wailers have used it to their advantage.\nI will not rest until I have made the Wood Wailers regret interfering with my research.\nIn fact, I will go as far as to procure more crystals.\nPlease, Forename─if you can spare the time─bring the wain back to me.
