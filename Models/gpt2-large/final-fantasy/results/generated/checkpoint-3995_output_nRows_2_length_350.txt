Title: A Beeautiful Plan
Dialogue: ['\nMogoon:', '\nThe plan I hatched was a simple one─and it was. We gathered materials from the nearby hives, and together we crafted a makeshift net to catch our smallmouth hornets and redbears.\nThe problem was, none of the beasts we had collected were fit for the task.\nAt first, I attempted to remedy the situation by procuring more of the same from the nearby nests, but that proved fruitless. The problem was, none of the beasts we had gathered were fit for the task.', '\nMogoon:', '\nThe problem was, none of the beasts we had gathered were fit for the task.', '\nMogoon:', '\nYet still, the plan was sound. It was only a matter of time before the bugs returned, but I had faith that I had made the right decision.\nBut then the unthinkable came to pass. The bugs came back, and none of the materials I had collected was fit for use.\nMogoon, you see the situation with your own eyes. Had I not been so adamant in my decision, I doubt you would be standing here, ready to make a valiant effort.\nMogoon, I am troubled by something. Could you procure more of the same from the nearby hives?\nIf I do not convince you of my decision, perhaps you will?\nMogoon, I do not know what to say. Please, you must procure more of the same from the nearby hives.\n', '\nMogoon:', '

Dialogue: ['\nTeteroon:', "\nIf I may, sir─you're the one who was tasked with leading the first group of scouts to the Fringes, right? If you could help it, I'd be ever so grateful if you could set up a new position for me.\nIt's a simple enough task. I need you to head out to the east, and make sure no imperials are hiding around there.

Still, it's best to take cover if an imperial attack comes.\nAnyway, what I really mean is that I need you to keep an eye on the cove.

You've made a fine start, and I'd be lying if I said more effort was not needed.\nThe hive's still in sore need of repairs, but I've got a plan B and C─scatter bees about the site to bait flies with nectar, then swab the area for swarms.\nThe plan B is a simple one, and B'zhettob is on board with it. I just need you to sprinkle some nectar on the bees─make sure they feast on the scum, of course.\nThe plan C─and this is the tricky bit─is to keep the bees away from the hive.

Dialogue: ['\nUrokuzu:', '\nWell, if it isn't my good-natured yet feckless lab assistant! Welcome to Aporia, where all manner of experiments are conducted!\nI should mention, however, that I must warn you that this place is no place for the faint of heart. We do what we can to keep the abominations at bay, but if they were to spread their spores to other areas of the castle, there is no telling what would happen!\nThat said, I am not entirely disheartened. I still see some hope in the new queen bee, despite her rather dismal record. In fact, I would venture to say that her addition to the brood might be the most important development of the castle's history thus far!']
