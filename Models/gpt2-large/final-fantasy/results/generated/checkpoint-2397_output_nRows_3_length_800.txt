When you have gathered all the beeswax oil, please place the cookies in the oven.\nAh, you have finished gathering the beeswax oil. Were you able to obtain the quantity I asked for?', '\nYugiri:', '\nHmmm...

We would all benefit from learning from one another.\nOh, yes. I am sure that I made a mistake in assuming that you would be willing to discuss this matter with me.

Dialogue: ['\nBenedict:', "\nAh, my lord Forename, I see you've not been resting on your laurels since last we met.\nI've a new composition for you, and it's more than a simple retelling of the tale.\nI would give you the full experience of the harp, but I fear you may be wary of its origins.\nThis instrument was borne to us by an Ul'dahn artisan who specialized in music of the harp.\nIts name, the Domansharp, is a reference to the Domansharp, a type of musical instrument that was once common in Ul'dah.\nAs a Domansharp is wont to do, he combined elements of various instruments, creating a unique fusion of melody and sound.\nTo this day, the Domansharp remains a mainstay in Ul'dah's music repertoire.\nI wish to take you on a journey through its rich history, and that starts with this harp.\nWhen the Domansharp first came to be used as music, it was made from a broken harp found in a cave in western Thanalan. I believe its history began with the first Ul'dahn to use it─a man named Gundobald.\nIt was during one of his many labors that he unearthed a wooden box that was likely used to house a harp. From that, he made the connection that the Domansharp was indeed a type of harp, and that it was his ultimate creation.\nI am pleased to say that the Domansharp is more than a simple retelling of the tale─it is a fascinating glimpse into the history of the instrument.\nFrom that, I feel confident that we can tell you more about the Domansharp's history.\nWhen I first conceived of this piece, I knew I wanted to capture the spirit of the Domansharp's music, but I also knew that I wanted to evoke the image of a young Ul'dahn boy playing the harp.\nThat boy would be you─Forename, if you will indulge me.\nI would have you journey into the past, where the Domansharp first came to be used as music, and meet with the boy who first conceived it.\nI would also have you play a song from its history to help paint a picture of its rich history.\nPlease make your way to western Thanalan and meet with a boy who calls this place home.\nI am certain that you will find him a most welcoming and informative audience, and I look forward to telling you more of my journey.\n", '\nBoy:', "\nOh, my name's Forename. You're an adventurer?\nOh, it's you, isn't it?

You want to hear the story?\nOh, thank you! It's been a long time coming, but I'm finally ready to hear it!\nWhen I heard that the Domansharp had been used as music, I was certain that it had some relation to the boy who first conceived it, but I didn't expect it would be so inspiring.\nIt's said that the Domansharp was once played by Gundobald himself, and that it was his greatest creation.\nIt was so inspiring that it inspired a second, lesser-known piece of music─a piece that's even more beautiful
