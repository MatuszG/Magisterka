So, what did you bring back of the color of eternity?', '\nGullinkambi:', '\nHmmm... This is a very nice hue indeed. Colorants from this region are known to possess this property.\nIt is said that, when mixed with certain minerals─such as antimony─the resulting colorant will remain stable for centuries.\nI am fascinated to know what purpose this would serve, but I suppose we shall never know for certain until we have the crystal.\nThank you again for your help. I shall be sure to reward you in some fashion.\nAnd here, for your troubles, is a fitting payment. I hope you enjoy your time with me, Forename.']

Dialogue: ['\nQefiraz:', '\nI cannot thank you enough for saving my life. You have my deepest gratitude. If you would allow me to repay you, it would be to ask for your help once more.\nI was born with a weak heart. As a child, I was trained to hunt by a hunter friend of mine, Qefiraz. We would go on many hunts together, and when I became pregnant, I lost my only son.\nHe was a warrior, and a friend to every child in our village. He would take pride in training my child, and fight beside him when he could not.\nHowever, a hunter is only as good as the number of men he can turn to for support. I could never be a hunter if I could not find other men to train with.\nThe other day, I was out gathering herbs when I came across a burly man. I asked him if he would train me, and he said yes. I have been training with him ever since.\nHowever, I recently broke his spear. I do not know what caused him to break it, but I am quite certain that he has attacked another hunter.\nI would go and search for him, but I do not want to be late for our next hunt. Please go to Meryall Agronomics and ask for him. He should be somewhere nearby.', '\nQefiraz:', '\nPlease go to Meryall Agronomics and ask for him. He should be somewhere nearby.', '\nQefiraz:', "\nThank you for finding my old friend. He said he would train me, but I have been so busy training that I have barely had time to talk.\nI would like to thank you as well for helping to save my son. He is a good boy, and better than most people give him credit for.\nPerhaps one day I will be able to repay you for training me. I do not know, though. Until then, I will continue to train in the shadows. Please give my thanks to Qefiraz."]

Oh dear, I am so sorry to hear that. I thought he might be somewhere nearby, but I did not expect him to be found so far away.\nI would like to give him some sort of treatment, but I know nothing of what would be appropriate. Please say you will help.\nI will try to search the area near the river, but I cannot guarantee that I will be able to find him in time. Please say you will search for him as well.", '\nAganbold:', '\nSer Joellaut spoke with some of the residents, and I think I know what he would have asked for. Please say you will help find him.', '\nAganbold:', '\nDid you find him? Was he in good health?', '\nAganbold:', '\nThank goodness. I was worried for a moment there.\nI am told that the residents of Fortemps are extremely strict about maintaining their wards' physical and mental fitness. The boy must be fit for battle, or he will be outcasts for life.\nHe mustn't let that stop him, though. He will get stronger and stronger as we speak. And thanks to you, he is now more likely to live a happy and productive life.\nI knew that was a mistake. I should have never sent him here. But please accept this as a small token of my gratitude.']

Dialogue: ['\nSeverian:', "\nI'm sorry, Forename─can you spare a moment? I have need of a trustworthy lad to travel to the Crystarium and deliver a message.\nI would entreat you to accompany me in my stead, but I fear I am ill equipped to do so.\nI require your aid in gathering provisions for the journey ahead. I have marked some suitable locations on your map.\nI ask that you travel to these locations and gather provisions. Pray return here once you have accomplished your task.", '\nSeverian:', "\nI ask that you travel to these locations and gather provisions. Pray return here once you have accomplished your task.", '\nSeverian:', '\nAh, Forename─everything appears to have been accounted for. How did you fare?', '\nSeverian:', "\nExcellent. I knew I was right to entrust the delivery to you.\nThe boy is quite intelligent, and a natural leader as well. He would make a fine commander.\nHis name is Conrad. I knew I would be glad to have him as a peer.\nAnd I trust you are aware that our scouts have been dispatched to the west to ascertain the enemy's movements? That is to say, our primary concern now is to prevent any potential Allied advances.\nConrad and I will remain on the lookout for signs of an Allied attack, but we will also be on hand to provide assistance should any Serpent Reavers attempt to take our position.\nI thank you again for your help. I look forward to our next encounter."]

Dialogue: ['\nFafafono:', "Hm? Forename? I wasn't expecting a reply, but I suppose you might be able to lend a hand.\nYou see, my son has been quite insistent that I send him to the Forum on an errand for the day.\nI know how that sounds, but “going on an errand” is not something I can readily “do.” I understand that it sounds childish, but he's stubborn as a three-year-old child.\nSo I thought to myself, “Fine, I'll help him, but only if he does his errand in my stead.”\nBut I'm worried about how he'll cope on his own! He's never played with other children, and I know he'll be bored out of his gourd if he's asked to do a task by himself.\nWhich is why I'm planning to deliver this message to him on my own.\nI want him to see how brave you are, and to know that you are not scared of asking for help!\nI hope I can persuade him to hurry to the Forum, but please, hurry along! I cannot wait to tell him how brave you are!", '\nPopmessage:', 'The enemy is still about!\nYou sense a hostile presence!']

A moment of your time, if I may?\nA friend and I planned to go on a fishing trip this evening, and I would like you to accompany us.\nIt is a simple plan: we will meet at the river, where there are some old sunken ships that we can fish.\nHowever, the river was infested with a variety of monsters not long ago, and I fear that if we do not thin the crowd, we may be drawn into a vicious cycle.\nPray travel to the river and slay any beasts that you find. I would be grateful if you could do this on your own, but I would also ask you to collect any treasure you find on your hunt.\nI pray that the river will be as safe as possible for our trip.

Dialogue: ['\nBriardien:', "\nI gather from your expression that you are not from around here. Are you an adventurer? If so, you are a rare one indeed. I speak of a young one. He left to the Crystarium not long ago to look for a friend.

He would like nothing more than to lend a hand to him, and I am certain that if I offered to help, he would say yes.\nBut as this is something he has asked of himself, I fear I cannot do it on his behalf. But I can offer you this as a token of my gratitude.\nTo the best of my knowledge, this boy has not been sighted since he left the Crystarium.

I need to get it back, but I can't do it on my own. I need you to help.\nHere, take this here lance. It's a bit rusty, but it'll get the axe back to where it belongs.\nI don't know what I would've done if you hadn't come along.
