I have been waiting for you.\nI've been thinking about your meeting with Master Gegeruju and the kami he was observing.\nIt would seem you have become acquainted with the concept of a “kami-as-friend.” I think it was Master Gegeruju who first brought this notion to my attention, but I was hoping you might elaborate upon it for me.\nI would like you to observe three of the most fearsome beasts in the Sea of Clouds─the kagan, the kagan's son, and the kagan's daughter─and report back to me with your findings.\nBe warned, however, that the beasts are wont to flee when startled, and that if you slay them in numbers they can overwhelm you.

If you would be so kind as to teach him a lesson, you would do well to first speak with him.\nI am certain my boy will listen to you, but he simply refuses to listen to anyone. I know this is a difficult situation for me, but I would be much in your debt if you could teach him a lesson of sorts.\nFor this, you will need a disguise.

I thought he might be receptive, but I was wrong!\nI will not be held responsible for his behavior. I merely wish to offer him a gift─a token of my appreciation.\nI am pleased to inform you that he is a rather accomplished merchant, and a master of disguise besides. He should be able to provide you with the information you need.\nI hope that this will suffice as a token of my appreciation. Now then, I would like you to meet me at the Sapphire Avenue Exchange in Gridania.\nIf you would like to try your hand at disguise, go and ask the owner.\nShe can be found at the Sapphire Avenue Exchange in Gridania.\nI hope that this will suffice as a token
