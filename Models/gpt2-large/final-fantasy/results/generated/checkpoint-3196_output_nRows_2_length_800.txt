Title: A Beeautiful Plan
Dialogue: ['\nMuttering Mantis:', "No, no, this won't do at all! We've got no time to spare for a grand scheme, kupo!\nThe Mantis Empire is a peaceable, productive lot. If things keep going as they are, we won't have enough food to go around! We've got to think of a more efficient way to gather our food!\nI can think of several ways to do so─but I need someone to listen to my plan, kupo! Someone who will cheer me up when I'm down on my luck! And I can't do that by asking everyone in the Mantis Empire to help me!\nThe idea is so crazy, I can barely believe I'm actually trying it! But I know you're listening, so I can tell you're on my side, kupo! So listen well, and I'll explain everything!", '\nMuttering Mantis:', "You've heard my plan, kupo? Then I'll explain it!\nFirst, we'll need to find the perfect place to gather, kupopo. To do that, we need to cross the narrow and deep chasm known as the Thirstless Pit.\nCrossing it isn't as easy as it looks, though─I know it's not as deep as it seems, but it's still a long way down. The Mantis Empire doesn't trust anyone who's not a native, so we'll need to make our own way across it.\nBut when we're finally at the other side, we'll need to face the Thirstless Pit without making it this far. And I can tell you, I don't want to be that person!\nSo I went looking for a way to cross it myself, and stumbled across this old Mantis chest. It might look like a simple thing, but it's actually filled with all sorts of strange artifacts. I'd like you to take as much as you can back to Mestonia, and then bring it back to me, kupo!", '\nMuttering Mantis:', "All I need you to do is take this chest back to me, and then bring back as much of it as you've found to Mestonia, kupo!", '\nMuttering Mantis:', "All I need you to do is take this chest back to me, and then bring back as much of it as you've found to Mestonia, kupo!", '\nMuttering Mantis:', "Welcome back, adventurer! I hope this means I can finally make it across the Thirstless Pit without dying!", '\nMuttering Mantis:', "This looks to be everything! All of my planning was for naught! I knew I was making a terrible mistake starting with this, but I was so confident, I didn't see it coming!\nI might as well take this as a reward, kupo! Thanks to you, the Mantis Empire won't be plagued by hunger any longer!\nI had so many sleepless nights wondering if I'd made the right decision. What if I'm too ambitious? What if I lose all of my hard work? I can't do this, kupo!", '\nMuttering Mantis:', "This is all my hard work, from start to finish! It's all in this box, kupo! So don't take anything else, especially the fruit. I'll give you half of it back, just so you know what I'm thinking.\nI'm not sure what I'm waiting for... I hope I don't need this, but I hope I don't starve to death!"]

Title: A Beeautiful Plan
Dialogue: ['\nApasa:', '\nI must say, you have a most industrious air about you. I am ever struck by how faithfully you follow the plan that has been agreed upon─no matter how seemingly implausible.\nThere is a great and wise man─a man who knows more of the world than all of us put together─who once commented that one must be industrious if one is to succeed.\nI believe that you understand what he meant, and so I would ask you to speak with him once more.\nThe man is Brother O–App–Pesi─a.k.a. the “Elder Brother”─and he is a man who has seen more of the world than anyone should.\nI must ask you to go to the “Elder Brother” in West Hawkers' Alley, and ask for his counsel.\nIf you are successful, you will become the Elder Brother's protégé, and he will direct you in your future endeavors.\nIf you are not successful, however, you will be left to your wiles. I think you will find it enlightening─and possibly inspiring─to listen to the words of one who has experienced more of the world than anyone should.\nBrother O–App–Pesi has long been a favorite of mine. I imagine that this is because he so ably explains the workings of the great machine that is the “Plan.”\nYou will doubtless find it enlightening, as well. I pray that the knowledge you gain from this conversation will benefit you in your future endeavors.', '\nO–App–Pesi:', "\nSo you wish to become the Elder Brother, do you? Very well.\nNow, I will give you some advice based on my experience.\nWhen dealing with an unfamiliar situation, it is wise to first speak with the person in question.\nIf you wish to know how I would answer a question, please ask the question again.\nIf you wish to know how I would answer a question, please ask the question again.\n", '\nQuestion?:', '\nWhat would you say to a question?', '\nAnswer:', '\nWhat would you say?', '\nO–App–Pesi:', '\nHmmm... I think I understand what you mean.\nYou see, when a man expresses an idea, he may well be referring to multiple things.\nFor example, if you are dealing with a runaway creation, such as an amaro, you would most likely hear it in the form of a rooster crowing in its cage.\nHowever, this would not be considered an idea, but rather a phenomenon. Hence, “incorporeal” ideas.\nNow, speaking of concepts, I believe you are on the right path.\nTo wit, you should focus on the concepts that are most important to you. And do not be afraid to question others about them.\nLastly, do not be afraid to experiment. The world is full of unexpected and wonderful things that you will undoubtedly learn to love.\nI am certain that one day, you will find the concept you seek and become the Elder Brother that you are now.\nNow, I must return to my work. Please tell my dear brother that I look forward to his counsel.\n"]

Title: A Beeautiful Plan
Dialogue: ['\nRoustebant:', "\nI'm plumb out of ideas, adventurer. I know you're keen on this, so─beep─here's a thought.\nWe could─should─make a profit selling honey collected by the beehives. Bees are hardy creatures, and it'd be a shame to waste the bounty they've earned.\nBut, there's one more thing I need you to do for me.\nAfter plucking the nectar, you should deliver it to a man named Marcel. He's in the eastern quadrant. He's a trader by trade, and I reckon he'd be a good sort to receive the bounty.\nI'll wait here, and you take the north. Go east, and make sure he gets it.", '\nMarcel:', "\nHmmm, this is honey. Not much more to say beyond that.\nI see you've a keen eye for such things. What do you reckon he might be after?", '\nMarcel:', "\nBees aren't much, but they get honey, that's for sure. I'd be happy to sell it to him, but I need to know for sure.\nI'll give you a little something for your trouble. It's the least I can do to repay you for your help."]
