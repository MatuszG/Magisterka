Dialogue: ['\nGildon:', "Hail, sinner. Might you have a moment?\nA man who looks like you is standing right outside my door─and it's not just me.\nA trader from Ul'dah has recently come calling, and is eager to buy land here in Revenant's Toll for a new home. He's even offered to pay in advance.\nBut I won't play along. I'm not run of the same family that these men are.\nIt's my job to look after my customers, and if they want to buy land here I'm going to have to make an offer.\nI might have to accept payment in person, but I can't very well send someone over who might not be able to stomach the idea of a stranger taking their hard-earned goods. Might you come in and take the goods in?\nWonderful! Here you go. Now, if you take this as a token of my good faith, I won't hold it against you.\nIf you don't mind my asking, have you spoken with the trader before? I'm sure he would be thrilled to have a hand in helping to put his dream of owning a home on paper.", '\nGildon:', 'Wonderful! Here you go. Now, if you take this as a token of my good faith, I won't hold it against you.\nI know it seems a small thing, but could you please deliver this to the gentleman? I would be honored to do so.', '\nGildon:', "You've brought him his goods? My thanks.\nIt seems he's been in a pickle like this ever since the Calamity hit. He could've easily moved to Ul'dah, but instead he decided to come here.\nIt's a shame too─the Calamity made the area a lot more dangerous than it already is. Hardly anyone wants to come here, even if there's a chance it might be a good deal less dangerous than here.", '\nGildon:', "In any case, I'm happy to have made him a little bit more comfortable. It wouldn't have been possible without your help.\nHere's a little something from the both of us. Enjoy!"]

They are a proud people, and pride themselves on their traditions and art.\nCibleroit and I have long dreamed of opening a tavern in the ruins. It would not be a stretch to imagine that our establishment was meant to serve as a place of remembrance for our fallen, and a place where we could share our stories in peace.\nBut the day of our dreams came and went. The refugees still live here, and even now they are not safe. I fear that is all that remains of our hopes for the future...\nBut we are not lost to ourselves here.

Now, though I may not be a member of the Church of the First Light, I feel a special bond with the followers of our holy religion. In fact, it's what makes my life purposeful. You see, I am responsible for the maintenance of this instrument, which I have lovingly crafted over the course of my career. It was meant to serve as a means of transmitting sound to the souls of the departed, so that they might hear the call to prayer from on high. Sadly, not everyone is so kind. Some seek to profit from the graves it lies, others destroy it in their rage. In any case, I cannot in good conscience allow these vandals to profane the graves of those who have died without making an offering of some kind. That is why I have made arrangements to have the funeral of one of my most devoted followers taken care of. In fact, I sent word to the Scions of the Seventh Dawn that they should be informed of the situation. They are already aware of the situation, I should imagine. In any case, pray convey my heartfelt thanks to my friend, and tell her to rest in the peace of the Seventh Dawn.", '\nKoujata:', 'You come at a good time, my friend. Our priest has just finished speaking with the bereaved. If you would like to hear the tale in its entirety, pray do so from the pew in front of the church.', '\nKoujata:', "In the days of old, men used various kinds of tools to craft their livelihoods. These included hammers and sledgehammers, as well as rods and pickaxes. Of course, not all were capable of wielding such heavy objects with safety. That is why hammers and sledgehammers were often employed by the men of the Steppe. Not so long ago, however, these two tools were seen as mere mere luxuries, and wielded with nary a thought for their function. But then the gods guided my friend to make this device, which he lovingly crafted, and shaped it into the prayer horn he now carries. I cannot thank you enough for this, my friend. It is a small token of his gratitude that I offer this to you─and a small token of my sorrow that he must now bury it with the others who lie at his grave. I pray that, one day, you too will be able to hear the voice of your departed friend, calling to the heavens for those who need to hear."]

Dialogue: ['\nAlphinaud:', '\n...In case it is not entirely clear, the instrument which you have brought us is an amaro of the white, a species of which we have recently received a sample.\nIt is of this species that you are requesting samples.\nNaturally, the amaro of the white are wont to prefer instruments of this type, and we can readily see why.\nBut there is another reason why you might prefer this particular instrument.\nIn the Old World, the horn of the gazelle is sacred. The practice of using it in battle is quite ancient, and is found in all the great religions of the world.\nIt is in the presence of this animal that the user of the staff attunes himself to the divine will, and thereby attunes to the aetherial resonance of his weapon.\nYour weapon will resonate with the aetherial energy of the gazelle, and this energy will be released when the staff is used. This will be most effective when the staff is in the hands of a capable practitioner.\nFor your next task, I would like you to visit the grove to the west and gather four samples of the hair of the gazelle.\nGather these samples, and deliver them to Ala Ghiri at the Ruby Bazaar. She will be pleased to hear that you have honored her request.', '\nAlphinaud:', '\nIt should be noted that, in accordance with ancient custom, I would ask that you collect the hair of the gazelle in question not once, but twice.\nYou are not to collect the second sample until after you have successfully completed the first.\nI realize that this is a rather drastic step, but the benefits of the second gathering are not to be underestimated.\nPlease make good use of your time in collecting the samples. I am certain that you will be back at the Ruby Bazaar before long.', '\nGazelle:', '\nHmmm? Yes, yes, I am pleased to see you again.\nYou have come at a good time, my friend. I have a favor to ask of you.\nI would like you to deliver these samples to a man named U'jughal at the Bazaar. He will be pleased to hear that we have honored his request.', '\nUjughal:', "\nAh, you've come at a good time, my friend. I have a favor to ask of you.\nI would like you to deliver these samples to a man named U'jughal at the Bazaar. He will be pleased to hear that we have honored his request.", '\nAlphinaud:', '\nGazelle hair samples, have you been received?\nAh, so these are as fine a samples as I had hoped.\nThe wood you have brought us is of the finest quality, and the texture is smooth and resilient.\nThese will be the perfect samples to test the efficacy of our amaro staff.\nYou are doubtless wondering who would be happy to have this gift─after all, this is a holy duty! Well, the answer is quite simple: it is you, my friend.\nWhen you wield your weapon, a certain energy is released, and this energy is felt by the wielder as well.\nThese are perfect samples to use in testing the efficacy of our amaro staff. I am certain that you will be pleased to have this gift.', '\nUjughal:', '\nWelcome back, my friend. You have honored our request with your handsome gift.\nNow, as you may have noticed, this is a rather large horn. As such, it is not easy to carry about. I imagine that you must find a way to carry it about that is not too cumbersome.\nI am certain that you will find a way to do so, and I am sure that others will be pleased

Dialogue: ['\nWichard:', '\nYou have a sweet-looking instrument in your hand, yes? Of course you do.\nYou may have heard that we conduct a weekly ministration to the poor. This service is offered in the cathedral, and is open to all who are not excluded from the regular services.\nThis ministration is, of course, inseparable from the sacraments. Blessed are you to receive them, and you are most welcome to do so now.\nThe Blessed Sacrament is a simple but profound medicine that restores the bodily humours. One who has received the medicine is said to be in a blessed state.\nTo ensure that your intentions are genuine, it is important that you explain the reasons for seeking medicine in the first place.\nThe most common reasons are: hunger, sickness, and fear. But there is no need to list them all. The elderly may be especially susceptible to these ailments.\nWhatever the reason, if you wish to minister to them, it is essential that you find a way to procure the medicine.\nIn that regard, I would suggest you speak with the caretaker of the cathedral. He can guide you in this matter.', '\nWichard:', '\nWhatever the reason, if you wish to minister to them, it is essential that you find a way to procure the medicine.', '\nCaretaker:', "\nWelcome, welcome!

He's always been able to find a willing heart in a most unexpected place.\nI imagine the same is true of your patient. Mayhap you might be able to help her father in his search?\nThat's all I have to say. I pray you find a willing heart in her father.", '\nWichard:', '\nWhatever the reason, if you wish to minister to them, it is essential that you find a willing heart in their father.']

I'm sure you must be quite busy with your many commissions.\nI was just finishing up a recent call and had just finished off my latest batch of sweets when I received word that Master Bloefhiswyn had arrived.\nBloefhiswyn is the proprietor of Gelmorra, one of Limsa Lominsa's most exquisite confectioneries. You would be hard-pressed to find a better confectionery in all of Thanalan.\nHe is a man of many titles, but I am reminded of one by name only: “The Gelmorran,” for he is ever seen clad in his finest silks.\nIt was almost a shame that the Master was not here to see the arrival of this most special of confections. Alas, the guildmaster is quite busy and has not the time to attend to my every whim.\nI am, of course, also indebted to you for your timely delivery. Master Bloefhiswyn will surely be pleased to know that his sweets have arrived safely.\nAs I mentioned, this is the first time I have met the master. Needless to say, he was immaculate in his attire, with a white gorget and a pair of pearl ear-piercing ear-rings.\nI must say, I was rather taken aback by the wealth of his wealth. In fact, I find myself beset with unease, for with this wealth did he amass such opulent treasures? Why, if I had the gil, I would take the jewelry right off your hands, I would!\nMaster Bloefhiswyn is a true master of confectionery. It is no exaggeration to say that I have had the honor of knowing many a Master of the Gelmorran.\nIn fact, it was during my time as confectionery master that I first encountered the likes of Master Jalzahn, Master Sthalrhet, and Master Azeyma.\nNone of these men would have been able to match the Master's wealth if it had not been for the Gelmorran, who has blessed us with countless creations.\nNow, I realize that this is only the half of it. You see, I am truly honored to be able to make your acquaintance. I am forever in your debt."]

Dialogue: ['\nChloris:', "\nAh, Forename, impeccable timing. You have just the perfect moment to make your acquaintance with one of our most accomplished apothecaries.\nIt would not do to keep our most valued assistant waiting.\nI would have you deliver this bottle of tonic to a patient in the Acorn Orchard.\nThe gentleman in question is an elderly gentleman who has recently suffered a stroke. He has been under the weather for some time, and I am pleased to see that his condition has improved dramatically.\nHe will be pleased to hear that his medicine is being delivered, as well.

In that case, might I trouble you to take the medicine to the gentleman in my stead?

I would be most grateful if you could deliver the tonic to the gentleman at my request.", '\nAccomplished Apothecary:', "\nOh, hello there. I'm Accomplished Apothecary, and who might you be...?\nOh, my name is Accomplished Apothecary. You are the man who just delivered the tonic to the elderly gentleman in the Acorn Orchard. A pleasure to make your acquaintance.\nYou have done a most noble deed this day. I would share with you my life story. It is a long and storied one, you know.\nIn ancient times, man was thought to be nothing more than a beast of this earth, born of sin and corrupted by the Light. But, through the great Ones' Mercy, we have been liberated from our darkness...and in so doing, have been granted the gift of sight.\nSo it was that I set out on my journey to become the greatest apothecary that ever lived. That is why I took the time to make the acquaintance of such a renowned practitioner as you.\nNow, as you may have already gathered, the path that I set out on was fraught with peril. Suffice it to say, I was not unprepared for the trials that I would face.\nBut I would not be so foolish as to deny the one thing that I now know to be true─the gift of sight. I would have you aid me once more, to set me on my new course.\nThe gift of sight is the greatest gift that man has ever received. It is a gift that was bestowed upon me by the One who sent me into this world.\nAnd by giving my life to see it to fruition, I have gained something of priceless value─my freedom.\nI no longer fear the darkness that envelopes me, for there is no darkness that I have been blessed with the gift of sight to see.\nI look upon my life with a newfound understanding, and I know that I have chosen the right path for me.\nKnow that I am not saying that all who take up medicine in the name of medicine are deserving of its benefits. Quite the contrary, I am saying that many who take up medicine are not deserving, and that it is our duty to give them hope and inspiration.\nSo long as I live, I will strive to give medicine the power to cure what ails us─a wish that you, as well as I, can make possible.\nSo I ask you, friend: take up your medicine and give it your utmost. I am certain that, together, we can set the poor soul of whom you just delivered his medicine an excellent night's rest.\nWelcome back, Forename. The tonic is yours to enjoy. I hope that it will afford him a respite from his troubles."]

Tell me, what did you think of the Garleans in the Coliseum?\nThey were a fearsome enemy, to be sure, but I couldn't help but wonder... I mean, if they were as great as they were made out to be, surely the Doman tribes would have found a way to at least come to a mutual understanding.\nBut naught could be further from the truth. The Coliseum was a mere opportunity for the Doman tribes to raise their spirits, to show their strength to their neighbors─but it was also a means to an end.\nTo the Garleans' benefit, the Doman tribes banded together and agreed to a common goal: the liberation of Ala Mhigo. To the Garleans' detriment, the Doman tribes banded together and agreed to a common goal: the liberation of Ala Mhigo.\nAnd so the Coliseum was born, a gathering place where the peoples of the Near East might come together to express their differences and find common ground.\nTo be sure, there were those who objected to the idea of a common enemy. They said it would only raise the spirits of our enemies, weaken our allies, and enthrall our children to hatred. But to my mind, the idea was too good to resist.\nMy fellow Doman tribesmen, I ask that you join me in this endeavor. Together, we will drive the imperials out of our lands.\nMy fellow Doman tribesmen, I ask that you join me in this endeavor. Together, we will drive the imperials out of our lands.\nSo you see, the only way to liberate Ala Mhigo from the Empire is to drive them from our lands.\nAnd by joining with us, you have already made the first step. You have my word on that.\nNow, we will begin the work in earnest. We shall strike at the heart of the Garlean Empire, the Magna Glacies, that we might find and destroy their encampment there.\nI have my men under observation in the area. Let us meet back here when you are ready, my friend. ", '\nCibleroit:', '\nWelcome back, my friend. I trust you were able to find a way to convince the Doman tribes to come together for the purpose of liberating their homeland?\nAye, this is precisely what I intended.\nNow, it bears mentioning that this was not an easy decision to make.

You have proven yourself a capable fighter, and have earned the respect of your fellow Doman tribesmen.
