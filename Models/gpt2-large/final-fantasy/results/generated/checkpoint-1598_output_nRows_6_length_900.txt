Title: A Bargain Struck
Dialogue: ['\nEstinien:', "\nYou...you're Forename! Good, good! A few years ago, I made the acquaintance of a young adventurer. He wanted to travel the world─the journey might be long, but the destination is always the same─and so I asked him to take on some dangerous work for me.\nHe agreed, and I gave him the task of slaying the beasts I had in my possession. I had no idea they were such dangerous foes, but I thought I might trust an adventurer to do the job.\nThe lad returned with three of the creatures, and I was so eager to see them go that I paid a little to have them killed. But when I finally got my hands on them, I found they had been taken by some fiendish magicks─dragons, to be precise.\nThey might have been taken by the Empire, but they could not have been the work of a single individual. I have tracked down their owner, and I am determined to find out who was behind this.\nMy inquiries so far have come to naught, but I will continue my search. If you have any information, let me know.", '\nEstinien:', '\nHave you spoken with the lad yet? He should be expecting you.', '\nEstinien:', '\nAh, it seems my inquiries were not in vain.

I shall not presume to know more of the truth until I have spoken with the lad.\nI shall continue my search, but I need you to look for the agent who sent you.', '\nEstinien:', '\nI have been waiting for you!
