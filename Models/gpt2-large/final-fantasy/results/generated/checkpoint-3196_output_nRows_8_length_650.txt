I trust you were able to find a suitable opponent to challenge?\nYes, this should suit our purposes quite well.\nAs you are aware, we are working with salvaged materia. The machines are quite intelligent, and will recognize the properties of any materia we place in their keeping.\nShould they learn to identify a fake, however, they will destroy it without hesitation.\nIt is for this reason we have asked the Students of Baldesion to procure as many as possible.\nI am pleased to inform you that, as of yet, we have only managed to procure a handful of their pieces.\nOf course, we will do our best to procure more as soon as we are able.\nWith your help, we will surely make it worth your while.']

Perhaps there was a way to make them more violent, if only in subtle ways.\nI came across an article in a Bozjan language describing a technique that they employed in order to make their weapons more deadly.\nI am convinced that this is how the ancient Bozjans did it, and so I intend to conduct research into this new technique.\nPlease inform Jehantel of my latest endeavor in the fields of ancient Bozjan artifacts, and he will see you compensated for your troubles.', '\nJehantel

Dialogue: ['\nHinuvali:', "\nHinu Vali is a researcher working on a new beekeeping technique. While her research is progressing, she is faced with a problem that none of her colleagues can seem to fathom.\nShe has been asked to make a delivery of three honeybees to a nearby hive. However, the bees cannot be found. Hinu Vali is at a loss as to how she can find the bees.\nWill you help her solve this problem?", '\nHinuvali:', "\nThe bees are nowhere to be found! Can you help me find them?", '\nHinuvali:', "\nWere you able to find the bees?\nExcellent! The honeybees should be nearby now.\nHowever, when I tried to approach them, they immediately turned tail and ran. I was so surprised to see them so frightened, I thought I would simply give them a gentle poke.\nBut they never come near me. Why would they do such a thing?\nI wonder if they are somehow connected to the pest problem. Perhaps they are somehow controlled by the people of the Greatwood.\nI will keep my eyes peeled for any suspicious activity. Thank you again for helping me find the bees."]

A blessing from Onokoro herself!?\nWhat's this, friend? Another song from the diva herself? And she calls you her friend? Hmph!\nI thought I told you to get lost. I was sooo focused on my task that I completely forgot all about her. I better get back to my task.\nThe song is called “My Beloved's Got You All Wrong.” It's about a man named Tsubhkhamazom who's in love with a woman named Latisha.\nThe song is about a man named Tsubhkhamazom who's in love with a woman named Latisha.\nBut in the end, the woman gives in to Tsubhkhamazom's advances, and they have a child together.\nThe child is a bastard, born with a Deidra's eye. He's a far cry from the loveable Latisha we know. And in order to teach him a lesson, Onokoro sends him to torment us sailors.\nBut since Onokoro is a diva, she sends the same bastard to torment us again and again. Eventually, we'll become so used to it that it'll become a thing of the past.\nSo when the child turns his back on his mother, I...I don't know what to do. I...I want to be a good son and a good father to him. But I can't do both.\n...Well, I guess you can try. Go and tell Tsubhkhamazom that we'll be sending another boy to torment us someday.\nBut before that day comes, I

Dialogue: ['\nPapawazu:', "\nA familiar familiar, are you? I am Papawazu, a researcher working on a new species of plant creation, but you must forgive my eccentricity. I am rather fond of instruments, especially those imbued with a certain grace. And I have a new one to which you may be privy─the kumiho horn.\nI recently acquired a sample of this horn, but it is too dangerous to handle in my current state. I would be grateful if you could retrieve it for me.\nIn my experience, any plant creation that utilizes horns as its primary source of energy is invariably doomed to perish eventually. I have no doubt that this particular species of plant will thrive once its horns are added to the mix.\nOnce you have the horn, please bring it to me. I will examine it closely before attempting any more plant creation.\nI am curious to know how the horn will evolve once we add it to our creation. Will it be as a walking tree, or perhaps─ Oh, I do not know. Either way, I look forward to learning all that I can.\nYou have my deepest gratitude, and I hope that you will cherish this gift as well.

But to what end, I cannot say.\nThey are loath to concede anything at all.

But our efforts will not be successful if we do not first heal the rifts that divide our people.\nUl'dah is home to the Temple of the Fist. The Fist is a peacekeeping force that serves as a bulwark against the sin eaters. It is our hope that the High Houses will come to see the value of peace.\nUl'dah is also home to the Stables of the Fierce, where the knights of the Holy See train in the preparation for their future battles. And it is our hope that they will see the value of training for their sons and daughters.\nI am certain that we will find the High Houses receptive to our efforts. That is my job, not to bemoan the difficulties we face, but to be hopeful for the future.\nBut enough chatter. I ask that you see to the envoy's well-being. Godsspeed, High Houses.']

I understand you've been working on your chocobo, and I've a feeling you've come to a similar conclusion as I have.\nBut before I get to that, there's something I'd like to ask of you.\nYou see, a friend of mine has a chocobo that's sick.\nI'd like to give it a few extra naps so it heals up, but I know it won't be easy. Will you help?\nIf you'd be willing, please head to the Church of the First Light in East Hawkers' Alley. There you can deliver a bottle of succulent poultice to a chocobo suffering from a burn.\nPlease make sure to give the bird a good rub down before you take it to me. I'd be happy to give it a few extra naps so it heals up.", '\nChocobo:', '\nGrrr...\n<groan>', '\nBraya:', "\nThank you for delivering the succulent poultice. I've already given the bird a thorough rub down.\nIt sounds like my friend is going to be okay.\nBut I've never seen a bird so injured before.\nThis could be a lot worse if not for the chocobo's natural defenses.\nChocobos are smart, but they're also fairly clever by nature. They know when danger is approaching so they can prepare for it.\nBut even so, they're still birds. And they're not made for the wilds.\nAnd as much as I'd like to help, I have to put this illness in perspective. I know it's only a matter of time before it gets worse.\nWhen that day comes, I'll take the bird back to its rightful owner. I hope you'll look after it as well.\nPlease take this as a small token of my gratitude."]

I'd heard tales of them, but to actually see one up close...it was too much to handle.\nI can tell you've seen a few, but I'm sure you've also seen the ones what look like they came straight out of a storybook.
