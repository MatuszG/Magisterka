Dialogue: ['\nTaynor:', '\nGood morning, Forename. I take it you have been keeping busy with the Resistance.\nAs you have doubtless noticed, Y'shtola and I have been working on a report of the utmost urgency.\nWe have yet to receive a single reply from the research and development departments, despite the fact that they are all precisely where we need them.\nIt would be ill-advised to send the Resistance any further in advance of the report's submission, so I should like you to fetch us three volumes of the personal records of our collaborators─Tataru, Papalymo, and myself.\nPlease make

I need you to go and fetch some water for the flowers.\nThe water comes from the flowers that grow in the wilds near the city.

You're just the man I needed.\nYou see, a friend and I planned to take a road trip from the Rosehouse to Ul'dah, but it seems the gods have intervened and delayed us.\nI'd like nothing more than to go and see the sights, but it's a trip I'd rather not make on my own.

Dialogue: ['\nDadanen:', "\nI'm glad you're here. I know you've been asking after the body of our comrade, but we're too far gone to recover his remains.\nHe died fighting for the Crystarium, and it pains me to see him go. I wish we still had him.\nBut we can't. He left a good-natured letter, which I'd like you to deliver to his mother. It's just outside the gates of Bentbranch Meadows.\nI know it seems a small thing, but I hope it means a lot to her. I'm sure she'd appreciate knowing his mother is okay.", '
