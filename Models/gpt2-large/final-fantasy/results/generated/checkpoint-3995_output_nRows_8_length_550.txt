I've got a favor to ask of you─mayhap more than one.\nI've been asked to introduce you to one H'naanza─a merchant who represents Limsa Lominsa at the Exarch.\nIf you're unfamiliar with the Exarch, allow me to set you straight. It's the seat of government for our city–states, and it is our duty to facilitate trade with foreign countries.\nNaturally, we have our fair share of disagreements with those nations whose actions we deem to be unwise.\nBut there is one thing that all nations should agree on: the treatment of our citizens. And by employing a system of taxation, we can ensure that our citizens are fairly compensated for their efforts.\nThe citizens of Ul'dah may be familiar with the idea of a levy, but do they know that it refers to a levy on the individual? Not so the Ul'dahns!\nThat's right─I'll be raising your levy! Yes, I can see why some may see me as an odd fellow, but I assure you that I will do my best to see that you and your family are afforded the same respect as I am.\nNow before you go, I must warn you that the Exarch is not a man to take oaths lightly. He has a long and distinguished background, and I would not presume to be the one to decide what sort of person he is.\nIf you wish to become acquainted with the man, you would do well to speak with Mistress Momodi. She is the resident expert in the Exarch and has a wealth of knowledge that would be well-suited to a budding adventurer like yourself.", '\nMimigun:', "You're the outsider, ain't ya?

As I said, I've got a team of taxonomists at my disposal who can come up with a name for the new levy. If you can help with the naming, I can think of no better a way to bring the glory of the Exarch home.", '\nMimigun:', "Welcome to the home of the Exarch!

We have tried, but we simply cannot afford to accrue further debt from our foreign patrons.\nYou may be surprised to learn that a substantial portion of the fee for our citizens to attend these negotiations is actually paid by the House of Commons.\nAs compensation, we levy a surcharge on all visitors to the Drowning Wench.

It is inspired by one of the strangest tales ever told of a sword─the tale of the Azure Dragoon.\nLegend has it that, when the Azure Dragoon fell at the hands of the beastmen, his blade was corrupted by the aetheric energy it absorbed.\nHe used the corrupted blade to cut a path for himself and his companions to escape the realm of darkness. It is said that he then chose to preserve the blade in a special way, and that it is now kept in a stasis container within the Ambrosia Labyrinth.\nTo see the hilt of my trusty blade, you would have had to journey deep into the heart of the Ambrosia Labyrinth. I imagine the experience was daunting at the time, but I am pleased to report that it is now accessible to you.\nOf course, you will still need a sword to perform your lessons. If you have no other need, you may leave the hilt with me. I will not hold it against you.\nThank you for your help. Please accept this as fitting payment for your efforts."]

I need a fresh set of gauntlets to replace those I've recently broken.\nI would be grateful if you could deliver them to my colleague, Byron. He works closely with the goldsmiths of Gatetown, so he can usually be found there.\nOh, and if you have any trouble finding him, you may want to use this code to find him: ['\nBriardien:', '\nGreetings, adventurer. What brings you to the Respite?', '\nBriardien:', "\nA pair of new gauntlets, you say? I'm not sure I follow...\nThe Goldsmiths' Guild has long been renowned for its innovative techniques, which are put to use creating designs that are both unique and functional.\nIt is for this reason that I was pleased to see the guild's representatives at the recent exhibition at Eshtaime's Spire.\nTheir work is uniformly impressive, and it is easy to see why so many admire them.\nHowever, their creations are not all hand-me-downs. Some are crafted with all manner of advanced techniques, such as tinker-work and materia.\nWhich is all well and good, but they're all... Well, I've said my piece. I would be grateful if you could deliver the gauntlets to Byron at Gatetown.", '\nRespitekeeper:', "\nPlease tell me you have the gauntlets.\nAh, thank you! I'm sure he was busy at work when you arrived, so you may want to wait a while before speaking with him.\nYou may find Byron at the entrance to Eshtaime's Spire. Just give him the gauntlets and he'll be along shortly!", '\nBriardien:', '\nGreetings, adventurer. What brings you to the Respite?', '\nBriardien:', "\nBy the gods, you've brought me my gauntlets! And not a single nick or tear! I can see for myself now.\nIf I'm to improve my fighting technique, I need to find new ways to apply what I've learned.\nAnd thanks to you─and to Gatetown for allowing me to attend─I have the time to do just that.\nI

Title: A Breath of Respite
Dialogue: ['\nFafajoni:', "It is no ordinary adventurer who may be granted passage through the White Wolf Gate. I am Fafajoni, Master of the Goblet of Urth.\nI am charged with overseeing the welfare of every last gulo gulo in this realm. Every one of these little creatures, myself included, deserves a good helping.\nBut the gods only know how many more slavering beasts lurk in the shadows of the portal. I would be most grateful if you could dispatch of two of them in my stead.\nI am told these creatures are native to the Empty Quarter. If you should find yourself in need of a respite from the hardships of the road, seek out Ceinguled of the Black Wolf. She is always ready to offer succor to the suffering.", '\nCeinguled:', "Welcome to the Goblet of Urth. What brings an adventurer to this godsforsaken place?\nAh, the wounded adventurer. What has happened to him?\nThe White Wolf Gate is closed for repairs. The only way to travel to the city of salvation is by way of the Goblet of Urth.\nI am loath to send you to such a desolate place, but we have no choice─the wounded must be treated.\nI will see you inside the gates, then? Good.\nI shan't keep you long. The sooner you can reach Ceinguled, the better.\nHere is your medicine.\nOh, and do not forget to take your gulo gulo. You will need it to get to your destination.", '\nFafajoni:', 'Good. You should have no trouble finding Ceinguled.\nI am told the gulo gulo population has grown in recent years. This is good news, as this means there are fewer to spare.\nI should hope this means there are fewer beasts prowling the gate waiting to pester the adventurer.\nIt is a small step, but I would be grateful if you could help spare another life.']

Title: A Breath of Respite
Dialogue: ['\nRespitekeeper:', "\nGood evening, sir. I'm quite busy right now, and would very much appreciate a hand with a task of import.\nI was tasked with keeping the peace in this area for a time, but I've been stretched to the breaking point. Even now, a band of outlaws is terrorizing the locals, and I need someone to put a stop to it.\nI would be grateful if you could dispatch three of them in my stead. You can take down their leader if you're willing to put down a few of their thugs.\nThe rest should be easy enough to spot. I've no doubt there are at least three of them.", '\nRespitekeeper:', "\nYou've taken care of the outlaws, then? My thanks.\nI've heard the bandit leaders are known to wield enchanted hammers. This would explain their ability to hit even the hardest of wood.\nThis is all the more reason we must maintain the peace. With them out of the way, I can finally return to my duties.\nThank you, sir. I will keep my ears and eyes open─I wouldn't want trouble between our peoples again.\nAs you may have noticed, the settlement here has been in a state of upheaval of late. Folk are often drawn to the sounds of nature, and I've no doubt that the hammers are a key contributor to the settlement's peace.\nIt was the work of a man not much older than me, you see, who once wielded an enchanted hammer. I've passed on his request to the Ironworks, so perhaps you can use this to help in your investigation.\nThe hammers can be found within the ruins to the north. If you'd like to investigate further, I would be happy to assist you.\nIf there are any other outstanding issues, I would be sure to share them with you."]
