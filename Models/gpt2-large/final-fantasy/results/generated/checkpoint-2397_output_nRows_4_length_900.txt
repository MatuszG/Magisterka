He was a dear boy, and I am proud to call him my dear manservant's father.\nBut, what of our dear nobleman? How did you fare? Did you perform a sacred ceremony?\nYes, he did. He was presented with a gift from his father, and sung a song praising his father.\nAt the end of that, he laid his father's broken heart to rest, and in so doing passed on to us his last will and testament.\nI pray this will suffice as an offering of thanks. I only hope that my dear manservant's father will continue to bless us with his presence in the years to come."]

Well, of course, I can provide ample warning, but I would appreciate it if you could refrain from discussing the details of the plan with me.\nOh, and if you should happen to see a fellow adventurer, perhaps you could introduce them? I would like to hear their thoughts on my initiative.', '\nEthelred:', "\n...And so you have decided to undertake a small-scale experiment? That is quite a decision.\nI mean to say nothing of the potential risks, of course, but the experiment is certainly...expeditious.\nI believe I can offer you a number of rewards, all of which I hope will encourage you to undertake the venture in earnest.\n...And yet I know naught of the method by which the rewards will be distributed. I should hope you have already contacted Rhilgr Himself, for such details as this must be conveyed directly to Him.\nI will also provide you with ample opportunity to rest and recuperate. If you would like to know more, pray speak with me again when you are ready to begin."]
