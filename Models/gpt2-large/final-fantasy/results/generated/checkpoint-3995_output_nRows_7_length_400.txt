It's my daughter's name. Listen well. It's the song she sings. It's the most beautiful piece of music I've ever heard.\nWhen I was young, I dreamed of being a musician. But there was no harp to play. No, no one ever asked me about it.\nBut then one day, a man named Mutamix appeared. He was incredibly rich. He had an enormous following. And he was playing the harp! It was so beautiful. It made me so jealous. I wanted so badly to be like him.\nBut then Doman decided to give up on being a musician and became a monk. And I couldn't understand why he wanted to be so different.

Dialogue: ['\nEsmond:', "\nHave you ever heard of the “celestial instrument”?\nLegend has it that, when the gods punished the wicked, they chose the gift of destruction: the axe.\nIn order to inflict their will upon the world, they bored a hole in a woodpecker's nest and left a gift of wood inside. This was later interpreted as a divine command, and instruments were accordingly created.\nAlas, some instruments are still in use, and we are unable to repair the one Esmond damaged. He is currently searching for a suitable substitute, but I fear he may be out of luck.\nI suggest you speak with the craftsman who made the instrument and inquire as to whether there is any truth to its existence. If there is, say, a quarter of an instrument's worth in gold, perhaps he can be of help to you.", '\nCraftsdwarf:', "\nAye, I'm the one Esmond mentioned. I've been working on an attempt to recreate the celestial instrument, but it's taken far longer than I'd anticipated.\nThe result so far is nothing short of spectacular. While not quite up to par, it's still an accomplishment to behold.\nWhen I first set about researching how the celestial instrument might be used, I made a point of studying the histories of each deity it was named for.\nIt was then that I came across a name that resonated with my soul: that of a great bard, who once wielded an axe in battle.\nWhile I cannot comment on the abilities of that great bard, I can say with certainty that his songs are filled with wisdom that will aid you in your quest.\nI should be able to provide you with the necessary funds to acquire a worthy substitute for the damaged instrument.\nPlease speak with

Our scouts have discovered their nomadic ways, and are constantly searching for suitable land to settle.\nThe problem, however, is that none of the suitable lands are suitable for a tribe of our size. Most of the land is too dangerous, or too sparse.\nThe most suitable place is the site of a ancient battle, where the power of the elementals was most severely tested.\nThe elementals chose that which they believed would be the most powerful when they forged the Azim Steppe, and it is here that we intend to commence our work.\nThe elementals gave this area a fearsome roar when they fought, so powerful was the energy it released. We believe that, should the Steppe be remade, that energy will be captured and used to power our weapons.\nThis is a daunting prospect, and one which we dare not take on ourselves. But if we are to make the necessary preparations, we must needs enlist the aid of adventurers.\nI have assigned each soldier a different task, based on their ability to best represent the elementals' wishes.
