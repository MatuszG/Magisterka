Dialogue: ['\nSeverian:', '\nThe problem is not the bees, though they are a nuisance to us. The problem is the hive, and the fact that they are not treated with the proper respect.\nOur bees are treated with far more respect than the average hive. The workers are given a proper meal, and even the smallest of pests are given a proper meal.\nBut to be fair, they are not the only ones to be praised for their kindness. The workers are also given proper provisions.\nThey are not permitted to leave the hive until the day they deliver the last of the brood. Once they have delivered the last of the brood, they must return to the hive to be honored.\nIt is our hope that this will all change, but the bees have not been kind to us thus far.\nWe have only recently been allowed to resume work, and even then, it was only after it was too late to do so.\nIt is our hope that the hive will also be able to take care of itself. If we are to be a part of the hive, we must feed, shelter, and care for ourselves.']
