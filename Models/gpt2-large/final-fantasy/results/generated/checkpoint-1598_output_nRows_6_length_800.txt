Title: A Boy's Errand
Dialogue: ['\nFaezahl:', '\nAh, Forename, just the lad I was looking for. I was wondering if you might come and visit with me.\nIt seems I was right to worry─you are quite the fighter.\nBut I think we both owe you an apology. I have no right to lecture you on the importance of discipline and hard work─I have not the faintest idea what those things entail.\nAnd I certainly do not need to tell you that discipline and hard work are not the exclusive province of women.\nYou are already well aware of this, but I want you to hear it again.\nA boy has been invited to the banquet, but he has not come with a weapon. He is of no use to us.\nThe boy's weapon is of no use to us.\nWe cannot afford to send another boy to the banquet, however.\nHe must be of no use to us. Please, go and speak with him. I shall wait here.', '\nFaezahl:', '\nPlease, speak with the boy. I shall wait here.', '\nFaezahl:', '\nPlease, speak with the boy. I shall wait here.', '\nFaezahl:', '\nPlease, speak with the boy.

Dialogue: ['\nYugiri:', "\nI've heard that you're one of the shinobi of Konohagakure. I've also heard that you're quite the fighter. What sort of battle do you enjoy?\nI suppose I should be glad if you had the time to spare. I've got a task that would make you an excellent shinobi.\nYou're a good-looking sort of fellow, aren't you? I'd imagine you're familiar with the concept of errand. That's the term used to refer to a battle between two teams of shinobi.\nThere's an area of the map called the Errand. It's marked on your map, yes? Let's see...\nOh, I see. Now that you mention it, I think I may have seen one of these in the past.\nAye, I think I saw one of these once. It was in the village of my youth. I was stationed there during the Sannen Battle─the first and only battle between the Allied and the Allied forces.\nIt was a very, very bloody affair. The only reason I remember it so well is because I was there. It was bloody awful, but I was there.\nIt was a day I'll never forget. I was so absorbed in my training that I forgot about the rest of the world. I don't think I've been back to the village since.\nWell, I'm sure you'll enjoy it too! Here's your reward for your hard work.", '\nYugiri:', '\nI'm sure you'll enjoy it too! Here's your reward for your hard work.']
