In fact, I doubt he would have been able to obtain one of these on his own.\nNow, if only there were someone out there who was willing to pay good coin for this... <sigh> I fear there is little chance of that.\nAt any rate, I am glad to have made the acquaintance of one who may be able to assist me.

It is a simple but effective means of communing with the forces around us.\nBy playing the horn to yourself, you will be able to draw forth the power of the amaro and use it to call forth the strength of the bard.\nNaturally, the horn is not to be played at your own peril. Should you choose to do so, be aware that you may be dealing not only with a marmot, but with an entirely new adversary.\nThat said, I find that simply hearing the horn will do a remarkable job at simulating the rich variety of sound that is the bard's calling.\nIn addition to being an effective means of communing with the forces around you, the marmot horn is a curious artifact in its own right. For one, it is carved from a unique substance─crystals of exceptional size and strength. For another, it is encrusted with a peculiar coating that prevents any further evaporation.\nEither of these properties makes it an excellent trophy, particularly for a warrior of your ability.\nNow that I think of it, I did not mention it before, but the marmots that inhabit Dravania are in fact a byproduct of the Sahagin's occupation of the region.\nThey were used as war trophies and as payment for subjugating other peoples, and it was only a matter of time before they were sent to be used in D
