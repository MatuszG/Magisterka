Dialogue: ['\nBertliana:', "\nWell, it's been a long time since last I saw Master Cid. I'm pleased to say he's returned─and with a gift.\nFor his efforts, he's been made privy to a rather unique gift─a figurative dagger, to be precise.\nLegend has it that the blade was forged by a goblin smith in the throes of despair, when all hope had vanished. The tale goes that the poor soul had no choice but to trade his life for the promise of a better future.\nAnd behold─the goblin's soul has found its way into a figurative counterpart. A sort of double helix, if you will.\nI say “double helix,” but it's really more like “triple helix,” as the masters of the arts would have it.\nI must say, the design is rather remarkable─aside from the obvious fact that it's a dashing, young-looking goblin. And the fact that it's both long and narrow certainly helps sell the idea that it's meant to serve as a blade of the sort used by the “old guard.”\nBut that's not all the gift Bertliana is offering. She's also graciously offered to exchange the figurative dagger for a real one.\nIf you can believe such a thing could be true, I can only imagine the amount of coin the goblin must have had to offer. Perhaps even more, if you include his soul as well.\nI would ask you only this once, but if you should see fit to trade the figurative dagger for a real one, I would be ever so grateful.\nI should hope that, after all this time, the goblins will still be around to offer you a deal. I can only hope that they won't try to scamper off in the wrong direction again...or that they'll finally realize the value of something that could be used for good.\nI suppose I can't offer much more than that, but you've made my day.

It would seem that the discovery of a new type of aether has the potential to change the world!\nA great many things could change in our lifetimes, but the one thing that is certain is that we have found a way to harness its power.\nI must thank you for your help, sir.

I'm sure you've heard of the “Bitter Snowcloak”─the village at the bottom of the cliff, where the Garleans laid waste to Ishgard and all of its inhabitants.\nAs part of the Allied forces' decimation of the Empire's forces, the Allied leaders agreed to the construction of an airship capable of carrying refugees to safety.\nThe airship, however, was not designed to carry refugees to the far reaches of the realm, and so the village was never meant to host anyone.\nYou see, the village's name comes from a precious gemstone─a crystal that shines with a brilliant white light when struck by lightning─which was once thought to be the sole property of the great wyrm Hraesvelgr.\nAs legend goes, when Hraesvelgr fell to the Allied forces, he left behind a sparkling gemstone that he could never be found. It was believed that, should his soul be dragged into the light, it would reach out to the people of the village and bring them succor.\nUnfortunately, due to the Allied's careless handling of the gemstone, its power was lost to the flames─and all who knew of its whereabouts were slaughtered by the Empire's forces.\nIn order to prevent such a repeat of events, the Allied leaders signed a pact with the Dravanian Horde, pledging to guard the gemstone with our lives should it fall into the wrong hands.\nYou see, we believe that the gemstone holds the key to our village's salvation. Should the Allied forces find it, they will know they have found the means by which to protect it.\nThat is why we have taken the initiative to procure a second gemstone from the same source that first yielded us our first. It is a far more delicate and delicate gemstone, so it is no small task to procure the right one for the job.\nI am pleased to inform you that we have succeeded in our endeavor, and have obtained a second gemstone─this time from the depths of the Bitter Snowcloak.\nWhen we first encountered this bitter snow, we mistook it for snowfall, but upon closer inspection, we discovered that it was the crystallized essence of a brambleweed─a rare and precious seed that grows only within the village.\nIf the brambleweed is found, the snow will turn to snow again, and if the snow turns to snow, the brambleweed will turn to brambleweed once more.\nThe village of Ishgard will be blessed indeed.\nI look forward to the day when the brambleweed can be found and brought into the village.

I mean no offense, of course, but I had no idea a friend of mine would be willing to help.\nI am not sure what I said to attract Bertliana's attention, but when I arrived in her village, I promptly ran into her and her people. She was all smiles and high-spirited, telling me all about how she had found the forest and befriended a fellow sylph.\nAfter that, I simply could not turn my back on her. I owe her a great debt, and I hope that she is able to do what she can for my homeland.\nBertliana is an excellent example of what we can achieve when we work together─and I am proud to call her a friend as well.

I've been following your exploits with great interest.\nLet me see...what did you defeat?\n...A giant sea serpent!? Well, if that's the case, I can hardly call it a mere beast. I daresay it's far stronger than the previous record-holder.\nAnd this isn't the first time you've defeated a foe this massive. You've even faced a giant sea serpent before─the giant squid. That was back in the days before the Calamity.\nStill, I must say that this is a feat that truly defies imagination. You must be possessed of a truly exceptional talent if you think you can defeat such a foe.\nI daresay you're worthy of the epithet of “Legend Killer” if you can defeat this creature.\nAnd if you are indeed worthy of that title, then I hope that you'll consider coming and meet me in the flesh.", '\nPop:', '\nSomething large and angry is moving under this sink!', '\nCid:', "\nI've never seen such a large fish before!

Dialogue: ['\nEtgar:', '\nAh, Forename. A pleasure to make your acquaintance.\nMy name is Etgar, researcher and creator of the Errand. I am honored to have been chosen to lead this new endeavor.\nI would have you assist me with a simple experiment.\nI would have you bring me three different types of moss─Ceruleum, Manderville, and Ulm's Respite─and observe them for a time.\nThe experiment should take no more than an hour, and the rewards─as promised─are rich.\nI realize that this is a rather large request, but I believe you will not regret your assistance.\nI am most excited to see how you will respond to the moss. I have high hopes for you, Forename!', '\nEtgar:', '\nI am most excited to see how you will respond to the moss. I have high hopes for you, Forename!', '\nEtgar:', '\nYou have returned! Did you bring the moss?\nExcellent! It is well that you came, but I must say that I was a little disappointed to hear that you were unable to bring me the Ulm's Respite moss.\nI am afraid that is all we can offer you, as the species is so rare. It would be a shame to lose such a precious resource.\nHowever, you are correct to take pride in your accomplishment. We all would be lost without the moss, and so we must do what we can to protect it.\nAs I mentioned, I would have you observe the moss for a time. It is an important part of our research, and I am pleased to be able to offer it to you for free.\nNow then, it is high time you learned a new trick.\nThe moss you brought us was covered in tiny, round, white crystals. I would have you place these crystals on the ground, and then observe them with your naked eyes.\nI would have you place the moss on the ground in front of the Crystarium, and then observe it with your naked eyes. Try it out, and see what happens!', '\nEtgar:', '\nYou have placed the crystals? Fantastic! Now all that is left for me to do is wait and see what happens!\nI must say, this was a rather enlightening experience. I am quite sure I am ready to receive guidance, but before I do, I would ask that you take this crystal and place it in front of me.', '\nEtgar:', '\nWell? Were you able to learn a new trick?\nHmmm... If the crystals were placed in a similar fashion to the one you placed the moss, I am sure that they would react quite differently.\nPerhaps the moss was placed in such a way as to attract a larger crystal? Perhaps the crystal was placed in such a way as to absorb the energy of the crystal?\nI am quite sure that is what happened, but I would like to know for sure.\nPlease take the crystal and place it in front of me. I shall go and collect more information.', '\nEtgar:', '\nWelcome back, Forename. I trust you were able to learn a new trick?\nHmmm... Were the crystals placed in a similar fashion to the one you placed the moss? Perhaps the moss was placed in such a way as
