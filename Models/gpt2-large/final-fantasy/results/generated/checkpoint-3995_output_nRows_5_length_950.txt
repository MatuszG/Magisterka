Dialogue: ['\nCeana:', '\nWhat brings you here, adventurer?', '\nCeana:', "\nA message from Ala Ghiri? I wasn't sure I wanted to bother an old woman with a question, but...\nIt seems that the sultana has struck a deal with the Resistance. She wants us to collect ceruleum from the Black Iron Bridge, from the ruins just below the palace.\nThere's been talk of a wagon coming from the port of Alnair, but I'm not sure if that's the one we're looking for.\nI don't suppose you have time to go and look for us, though.

I was just about to get a message from Ceana. Something about a deal we struck, apparently.', '\nCeana:', '\nOh, right. I should probably tell you what's going on.\nThe Resistance is holding a press conference in the Black Iron Bridge.\nThey claim to have struck a deal with the sultanate, allowing them to rebuild the Ul'dah port and reopen the trade routes.\nThe Garleans left a lot to be desired, to be sure, but the Resistance is not so easily convinced of their evil intentions.\nStill, the deal is likely to be good for the people of Ul'dah. It's up to you, Forename, to see it through to the end.', '\nAlisaie:', '\nSo the deal is good, then?', '\nCeana:', '\nWell, I should be getting back to the palace. I hope you don't mind the wait.', '\nAlphinaud:', '\nTime is of the essence, so I should probably go and collect the ceruleum. Should you manage to find the Black Iron Bridge, tell Ceana and I will be waiting.', '\nCeana:', '\nOh, thank you! I'll be sure to collect the ceruleum from the bridge before we go any further.', '\nCeana:', "\nAh, Forename. You've been waiting for me.\nYou've managed to collect the ceruleum? Wonderful! Now all that's left is to deliver it to the Resistance.\nThank you, sir. I will see this to the Resistance leaders in Ala Ghiri.\nI'm sure they'll be ecstatic to see their wares on the doorstep of the sultanate.\nAnd I can't thank you enough for helping me find this deal. It's a pity the Garleans managed to come along so suddenly, though.\nStill, I'm glad we reached a deal. I hope you'll be able to collect your payment on the spot."]

Dialogue: ['\nLuciane:', "I fear that my proposition has backfired. I received a letter not long ago from a gentleman named Bernard. He writes that he has a young man in his service, and that the boy is quite eager to serve. I am told that the boy's name is “Ser Alboise,” and that he is stationed at Camp Drybone in the Central Shroud. I daresay that Bernard has made a suitable choice─the lad is quite handsome, tall, and of sound mind. I should be most honored if the lad were to accept my proposition. I only pray that the decision is not mine to make...though I shan't deny it out of hand. I would be most honored if you were to speak with the lad at my request.

If you don't mind, I'll be waiting for him at Camp Drybone.", '\nBernard:', 'Beg your pardon, lord. I did not realize the reception I would be receiving....Ah, yes, of course. Ser Alboise of Camp Drybone. Lord Francel informed me of my promotion. He bids me welcome to the Resissant, if I may....Why not accompany him, Forename? You are but one step from serving him.', '\nAlboise:', 'The lad is at the very end of the Long Road, so I shan't keep him any longer. If you do not mind, I will be waiting for him at Camp Drybone.', '\nBernard:', 'You...you spoke with the lad at my request? <sigh> Of course I did. I do not regret my decision...though I shan't pretend that it was easy. The boy is a fool, and I shouldn't have been chosen for his service. But I am honored to serve him, and to have made such a fine impression. I shan't refuse him, now, will I? And I shan't keep him any longer, either. Thank you, Forename. I will not soon forget the look on your face as you spoke with the lad.', '\nLuciane:', "Ah, Forename. I trust the boy has made his decision?"]

You would do well to speak with him, for without your considerable skills, I doubt I would have been able to assemble such a fine set of replicas at all."]

We didn't care one way or the other about who won the fight, what sort of hero it was, or even who won the fight in the first place.\nTo complicate matters, we were all orphaned by the Calamity. We were taken in by the Crystarium, and treated to a rigorous training regimen that would make any warrior jealous.\nIn the eyes of our forebears, a hero was someone who set a brave man on his feet and gave him the courage to persevere to the end. Our tribe's heroes were those who dared to overcome insurmountable odds and achieve greatness.\nIn fact, one of our heroes was even selected for evaluation at the Coliseum, but before he could even take his place at the tables, the elder gods deemed that he had grown too old and that he was unfit to lead.\nBut to this day, a part of me wants to believe that somehow, through sheer force of will, he was able to rekindle the spark in his heart and return to the tribe.\nThat is why I was so eager to see you at the Coliseum. If you are able to win the respect of our heroes, perhaps you will be able to find the courage to carry on the legacy that they so dearly wanted you to carry on.\nI wonder, Forename. In your heart of hearts, do you truly believe that you can return and fulfill the promise that the elder gods made you?\nMaybe I'm just giving you a little extra to make the trip worthwhile. In any case, I hope that you will cherish the time you spend with us, Forename. It's been a long road, and we won't soon forget you!"]

As you are doubtless aware, failure is an option, and there is always a way to go even further.\nAfter all, a god is not made in a day, but a lifetime.\nIt is for that reason I have always believed that a god must be chosen, that he must receive the divine spark within him.\nThat is why I have always insisted that you represent us in the process.\nYou have done a noble deed this day. May you ever walk in the light of the Revenant's Toll, my lord.']
