Dialogue: ['\nCibleroit:', "\nHave you ever seen such a goodly young lad? No? Well, I'm afraid you've never seen aught like him.\nThe lad's name is “Bertliana,” and she's the daughter of a wealthy merchant. She was a maidservant to Lord Francel, and while there was nary a word of ill to her, she did her utmost to make him happy.\nHe paid dearly for her services─more dearly than he dared hope─and she left him a handsome reward. She left him five good suitcases full of goods, and we're good folk for parting with them.\nThe lad's a fool, he is, but I know from experience that such generosity is a rare thing. And that's why I'm thinking to entice him with a reward worthy of a gentleman of his station.\nI think it best that you see this to him, but I do beg you not to leave him in suspense. I daresay that if he's willing to part with the goods, he's more than willing to part with the lady as well.\nI do hope he won't mind if I... Well, never mind that. Here, take this as a token of my gratitude."]

One of my bees has decided to stay on the job and pollinate my flowers, but I need someone to keep watch from time to time.\nI would ask you to pick one of the hives─I'm sure you can manage it─and bring me its queen.\nA short while ago, one of my bees swerved and flew away.

It's not my place to worry about bees that aren't in a position to pollinate our flowers, after all.\nI'm sure you're curious as to what my bees do for a living. Here, I'll fill you in on a little secret.\nThey pollinate flowers to supply us with nectar.\nIn exchange for nectar, they lay eggs on the plants that grow near them.\nThese flowers are so precious to us, in fact, that we're forbidden from using any other pesticides.\nAlthough it does give me cause for worry, bees are by no means a dangerous species.\nIn fact, they're quite docile. In fact, some of my workers even feed off them.\nIn any case, thank you for keeping my bees in good health. Here─your reward."]
