But the stingers are no more than honeycombs, and the pests' favorite food, the beeautiful plan, is naught more than a simple bait.\nI see no way to rouse the goblins' interest in the matter, so we shall need to find a way to entice them to part with their meals.\nI would be most grateful if you could retrieve a handful of stingers for me.
