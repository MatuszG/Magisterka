Might you be the one who seeks the strength of the dragons?\nYou see, I was recently tasked with studying the effects of the dragons' breath on those within our realm. I discovered that the creatures have a habit of taking up residence within a single of our cities. I suspect you are familiar with this phenomenon.\nThe reason for this phenomenon, I believe, is that the dragons breathe a foul odor into the air that permeates our cities. This odor becomes even more potent the closer you are to the source─a phenomenon which is why it is so difficult to escape.\nI am of the same mind as you, but I would be most grateful if you could find a way to get rid of the odor. I would also be most appreciative if you could collect any samples you can find.\nI should also mention that if you can collect a sample of the dragon breath, I shall make sure that you receive proper compensation.\nIf you should find a sample of the breath, I shall make sure that you receive proper compensation.

Title: A Brief Reprieve
Dialogue: ['\nWawarukka:', '\nYou there! Can you spare a moment?\nA friend of mine─a man of great repute in the guild─is in a predicament. He has taken ill, and I fear he will not recover if he remains at the Crystarium for any longer.\nI fear, however, that it may not be possible to treat him at the Crystarium─I know not how long it will take, but I must find a way to bring him there.\nIf you were to help me, I would be most grateful. It is not easy to find a trustworthy individual, but I would be most grateful if you could help.\nI have already spoken with my comrade, who is stationed at the Crystarium. He will not deny the situation, but he is not certain what will happen should Wawarukka fail to find a suitable way to treat him.\nIf you search for him, you should find him by the entrance to the Crystarium.

Thank you for your help."]

Title: A Brief Reprieve
Dialogue: ['\nGerolt:', "I've got a job for you, if you're interested. You see, I was looking through some old magicked scrolls, and I found a passage which describes an island that was once home to a great wyrm.\nIt's not far from here, so I thought I'd ask some of the locals if they know anything of its existence.\nI managed to find a few locals, but they seem to think I'm asking too much of them. They told me they only heard rumors of the island and that it was destroyed by a great storm.\nI'm not sure if that's true, but I want to find out. So, if you're willing to help me, come with me and see if there's anything to be found.", '\nNpcb:', "Ah, there you are! I've heard of the island─it's said to lie somewhere to the north.\nBut I can't imagine a storm that big would've made such a small island so much trouble. Maybe the wyrm was somewhere in the depths of the ocean, or on the very opposite side of the moon.\nI don't know much about the beasties, but I've heard it's said to be a fearsome foe. If you find any of its kind, I'd like you to slay it.", '\nNpcb:', "I didn't hear any rumors of the island, but I've heard it's said to lie somewhere to the north.
