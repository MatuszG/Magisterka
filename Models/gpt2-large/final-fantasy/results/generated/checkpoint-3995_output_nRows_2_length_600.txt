Dialogue: ['\nCibleroit:', "\nAye─the famous “bargain of the century” that brought together the nations of Eorzea.\nIt was a deal that would have made even the greatest kings look like chumps. Yet somehow the powers that be managed to hammer out a peaceful resolution, even if they had to settle for a few shared territories and a handful of reparations.\nThe question is, what did the Garleans gain from their victory? I've been studying the available evidence, and I've come across some rather puzzling pieces of evidence.\nIf one is to believe the reports of the time, the Allied forces amassed a store of supplies and military equipment that dwarfs anything the Empire had at their disposal. If one is to believe the reports of the time, the Allied forces amassed a store of supplies and military equipment that dwarfs anything the Empire had at their disposal.\nWhy would the Garleans have been so confident in their victory? One might surmise that they had superior forces, but that would be far from the truth.\nThe Allied forces took an enormous amount of time to assemble their forces, and it is highly unlikely that they had the resources required to wage war with so few men.\nYet if there was no Allied victory, then who─or whatever─took the initiative to form an alliance with the Humes? The commonfolk had already succumbed to the Empire, and the mere notion of bringing the war to an end was too much for the Garleans to bear.\nThe Allied forces did not simply strike a deal with the Garleans. They went to war with the Humes on their own, and in the eyes of the Empire their victory was absolute.\nBut what of the Allied forces? Were they really that defeated? One might think that victories such as that of Limsa Lominsa would warrant celebration, but victory is not everything. After all, the Garleans had already sacrificed far too many men to bring about their victory.\n...But then there is the matter of the missing persons. It has been discovered that there were several Allied soldiers who vanished during the course of the conflict.\nAlas, many believe them to be innocent, and that the Allied forces would not have turned tail and fled if they were found guilty. Yet if the Allied forces are to be believed, there is no reason to doubt their claims.\nCould it be that these men were killed in a Garlean plot? That would be an outrage to the allies that have stood side by side during times of great danger, and it would raise all sorts of troubling questions...\n...But I digress. At any rate, it is time to resume the search for my friend. I will see that the Allied forces do not suffer any longer.\nI will see

However, it cannot do so while encamped within a hive.\nThus, we must find a way to transport the queen bee to where it is needed most.\nHmmm... A solution to a problem without making a single change is ill-advised. Yet that is precisely what we are attempting, so let us go with this.\nThe solution may seem ill-advised at first. However, if we carefully review the situation, it is not so difficult to see its benefits.\nA beekeeper is a busy man. It is not easy to find a moment to catch a breath.\nOnce you have found the solution, make sure to convey the news to the rest of the hive.\nOnce the hive has been sealed, the queen bee should return to the brood nest.\nYou may find the queen bee at Castrum Abania.

And I should not imagine that he is alone in this.\nBut to return to the matter at hand, I think it important that you remind the commander that his decision will have an effect on the survival of the entire colony. A colony can ill afford to lose one of its key leaders.\nA good message, though it is one that will likely be lost on Commander Ivonq. A good message, indeed.']

Excellent!\nNow, you're doubtless wondering how we can enjoy our salad without all that sugary goodness. The answer's surprisingly simple─and surprisingly delicious, at the same time!\nThe dressing has a kick that really wakes the stomach, so we always serve it with a side of grilled vegetables. Grilled vegetables are easy to come by in the Twelveswood, and what's more, they don't require any artificial sweeteners or colors to bring life to a plate.\nIn fact, I think it's only a matter of time until everyone in Twelveswood is served the salad that we maintain here.\nI can't wait to see the faces of those men and women who have made the trek from across the realm.

By placing the dead bees within it, he was able to preserve their aetherial signature, and ensure that their spirit lives on.\nA truly successful hive would not exist without its vital inhabitants, and I am pleased to see that the Marcechamp hive keeps producing healthy offspring.\nOf course, we would not be able to survive without the aetherial mist.
