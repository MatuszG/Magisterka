Title: A Bargain Struck
Dialogue: ['\nMogoon:', "\nAh, adventurer! I've been looking all over for you─and for an adventurer, no less! If you have the time, I would greatly appreciate you helping me with my latest endeavor.\nI'm in the midst of organizing a shipment of fertilizer, and need someone to pick up the last few sacks.\nI've scoured the area near Agronomics Biotech, but it's clear there are no signs of the men I've been sent to search.\nThey could be anywhere─even sleeping, if that much is true. As much as I would like to get them myself, I know better than to leave my men waiting.", '\nMogoon:', '\nThe last few sacks of fertilizer should be around here somewhere. Please, find them for me!', '\nMogoon:', '\nAh, you're back! Were you able to find the men?\nWonderful! With this, I can finally get back to work.\nThe men were taken during a struggle for power between the landlords and the soldiers.\nAfter a short time, the landlords took to hiding and using their power to accumulate even more wealth. They eventually agreed to the formation of the Allagan Empire, and the soldiers' training became more military.\nBut before that, they wanted desperately to defeat the Empire.\nI am still proud that we served in the Resistance, and we will always remember those who fought for our cause. Thank you for your help.']
