Dialogue: ['\nJantellot:', '\nI know that you are eager to hear about your task.\nBut before we proceed, allow me to explain what has been happening at Castrum Centri.\nIn the aftermath of the Battle of Carteneau, the Eorzean Alliance established a new base of operations in the Near East.\nThe new base of operations was established at Castrum Centri, a former airship graveyard now used as a military airfield.\nIn accordance with the truce, the Allied forces and the Empire jointly maintained a military presence at the airfield.\nHowever, a number of Allied airships were damaged during the course of the conflict, and the handful of salvageable parts from the damaged craft have been sent to Ul'dah to be repaired.\nUnfortunately, the task of repairing the damaged airships has proven beyond our capabilities.\nThus, in order to ensure that they can continue to fly as stable a platform as possible, a number of parts from the damaged airships have been sent to Ul'dah.\nThese parts are of a significantly inferior quality to those originally sent to Carteneau, but I will make no excuses for placing them aside in the interest of speed.\nI am certain that you are familiar with the logistics of the materiel delivery process. The task should be straightforward enough: locate the damaged airships, and bring back any parts that are of a significantly inferior quality to those originally sent to Carteneau.\nYour cooperation has been greatly appreciated, and I hope that you will continue to support our efforts in the future.\nYou should find the airship graveyard in question just outside the base. I would suggest attuning to it before you depart.', '\nPop:', '\nYou sense a hostile presence!', '\nAccess:', '\nThe enemy is still about!', '\nJantellot:', '\nSo, what have you brought back from the Graveyard?\nHmmm...
