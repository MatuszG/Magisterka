Dialogue: ['\nSisipu:', "\nGood evening, Forename. I'm pleased to say that the other youths have all joined in the festivities!\nWe're all here for a chance to see the famed “Twin Adder” up close and personal. That's right─we're all here to have a look at the dread giant, and─with the blessing of Halone─he's obliged to give us the chance to do so.\nAs you know, the Twin Adder was created to bring peace between man and elemental. To that end, he's been tasked with slaying the beasts that roam the plains─the “kingslayers” as we're fondly called.\nBut the Twin Adder has grown too large for his boots, and it's begun to show its age. Recent sightings have even led some to believe that it's on the verge of collapse.\nThat's why I'd like to propose that we all take part in a massive operation to drive it off once and for all. That would be a tremendous boon to the realm, wouldn't you agree?\nYou'll be joining us, yes? Well then, I'll get to thinking...and before I do, I'd like to share with you something that may prove to be of interest to you.\nThere's a rumor going around that a certain adventurer─you know, the one who won the “Eorzean Alliance” in the “Trials of the Braves,” to boot─is making an appearance in the Twin Adder. That adventurer is said to be clad in full armor, and─if you're willing to believe it─is transporting a massive weapon in his right hand.\nI don't mean to say that this weapon is anything special. In fact, I'm sure that even the most avid “Eorzean Alliance” connoisseur would struggle to tell you apart from a fellow member of the “Greater Good.” But nevertheless, it is of interest to us all.\nWell, let's get to the matter at hand, shall we? The rumor claims that this weapon is capable of destroying kingslayers. I'm positive that you're familiar with the concept, so I won't go into detail─save to say that, should the kingslayer prove to be a threat to the Twin Adder, we will tear it apart piece by piece, one piece at a time!\nThere is no telling what effect such an operation would have on the primal itself, but we would do well to learn for certain. For this, we will need your assistance. For this, we will need your assistance. ", '\nSisipu:', '\nIf you've a mind to lend a hand, I suggest you first speak with the man who first conceived the idea.\nThat adventurer is none other than our very own Alexander, and it was he who first conceived the idea of destroying the kingslayer. Alexander was born with the thought that the end of the world was nigh─that it was inevitable.\nBut that is all well and good, but the Twin Adder needs more than the power of this weapon. It needs an army of warriors who will tear it apart piece by piece, one piece at a time.\nIf you can bring me the courage to join me in this endeavor, it would not have been possible without your assistance. Pray speak with the man who conceived the idea, and he
