Title: A Bargain Struck
Dialogue: ['\nAlphinaud:', '\nThere is something in the air. A chill, a chill that is neither cold nor hot...\nThe chill is strong, but I cannot tell you who is to blame.\nWhat I can tell you is that the chill has reached such heights that it has become an insufferable nuisance.\nI fear this is the most dangerous of all the chill, and I fear I may be the only one who can end it. Will you join me in the search for the source of this chill?\nI would do this for you, Forename. We must find the source of the chill.\nYou should be able to find it by the north gate. I ask that you search near the entrance to the gate.\nYou should be able to find it by the north gate. I ask that you search near the entrance to the gate.', '\nAlphinaud:', '\nYou are looking for the source of the chill?', '\nAlphinaud:', '\nThe source of the chill?', '\nAlphinaud:', '\nIt is you, Forename. The chill was not the result of a single individual, but rather a collective phenomenon.\nI have no doubt that you will find the source of the chill.', '\nAlphinaud:', '\nThis is my best guess at the source of the chill. You have my thanks, Forename.\nI do not doubt that the chill was caused by a single individual. But how was it caused?\nThe answer lies in the details.\nIt was not the cold, but the chill that was made possible by the ice.\nI fear the same is true of the chill that came from the crystal, and that will be the last.\nI shall have to go on another search for the source of the chill. But I must not forget the good you have done for us.']
