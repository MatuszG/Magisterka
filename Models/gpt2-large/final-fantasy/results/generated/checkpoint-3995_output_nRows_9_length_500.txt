Dialogue: ['\nLuciae:', "Ah, a savior appears in my most desperate moment! I realize I am still quite flushed from my outburst earlier, but you have saved my life! You are a godssend, friend.\nMy husband and I agreed to purchase a chocobo from a breeder, but after a second look at the bird, we were not so sure.\nBut when I offered to examine the bird myself, the merchant told me that if I so much as questioned the breed, he would claim my husband had given the wrong price.\nSeems the merchant I spoke of was actually the breeder. I can now safely purchase my own chocobo. I cannot thank you enough, friend.\nNow, though you are a godsdamned businessman, do not misunderstand our bargain. This chocobo is for the sole use of my husband.\nIt will not be long until our next breeding opportunity.

I can hardly contain myself thinking of all the races I could have chosen from!\nAye, that's right─I'm talking about all sorts of races! My mind was made up long before I even walked through the door.\nThe fact that you are here at all, and that I am even speaking with you, proves the truth of what I told you before─our marriage was not forced.\nIt was a simple one, truly. After the death of our first child, my husband felt he had no other choice but to take up the bird.\nTo be sure, he did so with great trepidation. He knew he could never replace him, but he wanted to try.\nAnd so he went to the breeder, who agreed to match him with another deserving steed.\nThere was only one problem: the man who originally matched me had already given my husband his.\nNot to worry! I made the necessary arrangements, and that was that.\nI returned home to see my husband and his new chocobo. When I saw the way he rode the bird, I knew that the merchant who matched us was the one who had matched him, not the other way around.\nNow, while I am relieved

Now, if only I could convince the young one to take up the harp and give it a try..."]

As the envoy of Her Majesty, it is my duty to represent the Holy See at these negotiations.\nIn light of the recent clashes with the Vanu, I have been asked to submit a report to my superiors in the Foreign Service. As you may know, the Vanu are a people of great pride and history, and they have a fondness for gold.\nThe value of all gold is closely tied to the value of the gem which it is used to craft. The Vanu have been known to pay handsomely for anything bearing the crown.\nIt has become increasingly difficult to trade with the Vanu in recent days. That is why I have been charged with facilitating talks between their leaders and the merchants who supply us with coin.\nI will not be going to Ul'dah. Rather, I will be traveling to Ul'dah's port of Vesper Bay to meet with the merchants who deal in the city. Might I trouble you to accompany me?\nVery good. I will await you there.", '\nMerchant:', "Welcome to Vesper Bay, where fine wares from the East are guaranteed.\nIf you wish to inspect the goods, you need but say the word.\nIf you wish to buy, you need but say the word.", '\nDrillemont:', "Welcome back. I hope the meeting went well.\nI had hoped we would be able to reach a compromise, but it seems that the other leaders are not so easily sated with our paltry offerings.\nIt would be foolish to believe that we could amass sufficient coin to cover all our needs. Indeed, the guild's coffers are not nearly so empty as they are currently.\nNevertheless, we are not so easily discouraged from pursuing our goals. I remain confident that we can still find a way to achieve them.\nI would be most grateful if you could keep the merchants and sailors of Vesper Bay informed of our progress.\nIt was a pleasure meeting you, sir. I will make sure they hear directly from you."]

Dialogue: ['\nPuissant Porter:', "You've the look of a man who travels. Aye, a man not afraid to make a change. Would you be so kind as to take yourself to the Quicksand in the North Shroud?\nThe decision is ultimately yours, but I'd be lying if I said it weren't a moment of decision making that I was rather eager to see.\nA friend of mine, a man who goes by the name of Redwald, is in charge of the men who work the fields here. I'd be lying if I said more men of my choosing were interested in learning more of his methods.\nI'm afraid I can't spare a man of your talents, but you've proven yourself a capable defender of the people of Whitebrim Front. If you'd be so kind as to seek him out, I would be most grateful.\nAnd with that, you have my thanks. And with that, I should return to my duties.\nI won't pretend I understand your motivations, but at the end of the day, you are the man I wanted you to be. You have my thanks."]

Nor was I expecting the House Durendaire contingent to be led by Lady Minfilia.\nLady Minfilia is of course the grand mistress of the House of Commons. Yet even she has her limits, as I have learned firsthand during my many visits to the House of Commons.\nLady Minfilia has always been a firm-yet-fair teacher to my House Durendaire pupils. And in this case, the pupils of House Fortemps are not unaccustomed to the rigors of evaluation.\nThus it was not unexpected that the House of Commons would choose to refer to the trial as a “crisis.” But what is a “crisis” if not a necessary evil? Should the declaration of war be upheld, the price will be steep.\nLady Minfilia has said nothing to suggest that the House of Commons has any intention of withdrawing from the conflict. Quite the contrary, I believe her words to be a thinly veiled threat.\nLady Minfilia and her knights are already on the front lines.

Dialogue: ['\nLalai:', "Ah, Forename. It is good of you to return. As always, your keen judgment has served you well.\nI had been pondering my thoughts regarding the scattered letters that you recovered. A few of these might prove useful to us in our search.\nThe Scions, too, must be mindful to preserve their records. Pray accompany Papalymo to the archives on your way back, and I will see you are given the necessary assistance.", '\nPapalymo:', "Lalai sent you here? It's a relief to see you, Forename.\nAs you've undoubtedly noticed, the corridors of the Waking Sands are a harsh and unforgiving mistress. It is for this reason that we keep meticulous records.\nShould you manage to locate any missing Waking Sands documents, I would be most grateful if you could deliver them to my colleague, Dominiac. He works closely with the archivists, so you may be assured that his information is reliable.", '\nDominiac:', "Greetings, Forename. How might I be of service?\n...Hm? A letter? You don't mean to tell me someone else found it...\nForename! You've recovered the documents I requested!?\nI knew you would come through!\nI can scarcely believe it, but these pages are genuine!\nIncluded are records of the various guilds and their members. The histories are comprehensive, covering everything from the heyday of the Crystarium to the present.\nWhile we primarily concern ourselves with the day-to-day workings of the guild, there are certain subjects which have been deemed of more importance. Such records are designated as Special Subjects.\nI am pleased to note that, for a time, you were designated your sector's representative for matters of scholarly research.\nI imagine you must be quite busy with your numerous commissions, so I will not keep you from your task. I will, however, require that you submit your papers to the relevant departments.\nPlease submit your papers to the Research and the Collection.\nThe Archivist should be able to assist you with this matter. You might also contact her via the link above, should you desire further assistance."]
