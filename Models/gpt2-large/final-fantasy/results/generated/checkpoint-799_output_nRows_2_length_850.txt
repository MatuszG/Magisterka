He will be pleased to hear of your success.', '\nSeverian:', '\nI must say, the experience was indeed enlightening. I realize that the bee population has grown in recent years, but the phenomenon has a rather specific root─the honeybee itself.\nIt is clear that the solution is not as simple as it appears. But you have shown us the way.\nThe problem is not with the bees themselves, but with the food they consume. I would like you to find a suitable solution to the problem of the bees' destruction, and to show the people of Limsa Lominsa the way!\nAs you may have noticed, the area is heavily populated by honeybees. Many of the nests are nestled in the nests that are destroyed by the bees.\nThe solution to the problem of the bees' destruction, as we have proposed, is to lure the bees out of those nests and destroy them.\nHowever, it would seem that the bees are not the only danger. We must consider the implications of the destruction of the nests.\nThe destruction of the nests has a profound effect on the bees' population. It would seem that the destruction of the nests has a profound effect on the bees' population.\nI would like you to consider the implications of the destruction of the nests.
