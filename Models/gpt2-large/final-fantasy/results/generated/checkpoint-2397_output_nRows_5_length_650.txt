Dialogue: ['\nThancred:', "I know you've been busy. We've all been. But I've a proposal that might just work.\nI'm going to take some of the best minds in the field and put them to work. We'll begin with the most obvious: making preparations for an assault on Castrum Lacus Litore.\nThen, depending on the results of that assault, we might move to more ambitious plans. Perhaps we'll try to seize the Castrum itself. That would be an audacious move, I'm sure you'll agree, but I think it might work.\nAt any rate, we'll need a plan B and C if we're going to get anywhere in this war.

However, I'm not sure we need such a powerful weapon. If you were to build one for us, it would be our best bet.\nYou can find arcane crystals in the eastern part of Lacus Litore. Bring me three and I'll evaluate the possibility of using it.\nIn addition, you'll want to collect a number of magitek weaponry parts. Three should suffice.\nNow, we'll need to decide how best to use these. For this, I'll evaluate your ability to use magitek weaponry against a variety of targets.\nThere are three possible outcomes: victory, defeat, or retreat. I want you to evaluate each one to decide which is best for us.", '\nThancred:', "I want you to evaluate each of these against the three possible outcomes. Think of it as a trial by fire.\nIf you think you're up to the challenge, come back and I'll evaluate the results.\nIn any event, I hope you'll agree that a plan B would be a disaster. A plan C would be an excellent start, though I think it's unlikely we'd actually use it.", '\nThancred:', "I want you to evaluate each of these against the three possible outcomes.

Dialogue: ['\nHien:', "\nForename, I am pleased to say that your efforts have resulted in a resounding success. With your permission, we shall share with you a strategy that should prove a boon to you and your companions in their future endeavors.\nLet us begin by reviewing the particulars of your request. You wish to travel to the world's most isolated and inhospitable location, and seek out the legendary primal Garuda?\nI say “revelation,” but I think it may be more accurate to say that you seek the primal's knowledge.\nThe primal is said to dwell in the deepest depths of the deepest ocean, and is said to possess some knowledge of the inner workings of our world.\nThis is the first time a member of the Scions has even been able to reach this far into the unknown, and it is my hope that you will be able to learn something of use there.\nTo this end, you would travel to the shores of the deepest ocean, where you would encounter the primal in person, and attempt to wrest from it some knowledge.\nOf course, this assumes that you are able to procure the necessary items, which I am not. While there is little to be gained from simply barging into the primal's lair, obtaining the necessary items will go a long way toward completing your mission.\nShould you fail to acquire any of the required items, however, you will be faced with the grim prospect of returning to the surface and re-entering the water, where the primal may be waiting to pounce.\nI say “pursue,” but it may prove beneficial to wait a while before making any rash decisions. For your own safety, I would suggest consulting with an experienced adventurer before you make any decision.\nIn the meantime, you should continue your training and develop your bond with the elementals. When you are ready to undertake the next step in your journey, you will need to make a decision: do you take the path of the fish, or the path of the hunter?\nYou have my word that you will make the right decision. But it is not to be an easy one, and you will need to do all in your power to make it through this stage unscathed.\nYour journey continues with you to the shores of the deepest ocean, where you will encounter the primal in person.
