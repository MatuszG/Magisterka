It was during my time as a trader that I met and fell in love with a man from another land. A man from another world, if you will.\nSo when I heard that the merchant who offered me such a great deal was from the very same world as my new love, I knew right away that I must find him. And that is what I did.\nI tracked him down in Vesper Bay, where he was peddling all manner of goods at wildly inflated prices. I asked him why he was charging such a high price, and he simply said, “Because I can!” Not a single answer, mind you.\nAfter I caught wind of his shady dealings, I decided to approach him myself and see if there was any truth to it. I knew I could trust a man who had traveled the world─someone who had seen and known so many different people.\nThe man I met was a worldly, worldly man─I wouldn't be surprised to learn that he has an extensive background in the business world. It just so happens that I have an opening for a new employee, and he was kind enough to accept me into his employ.\nNow, I realize that this is a rather personal request I am making, but I think it would be best for both of us if you could speak with him for me.

He is an accomplished craftsman who has made it his mission to mold weapons and armor for the Garlean Empire.\nWhen you first arrived in Stillglade Fane, I was certain you would be beset with difficulty, and it was to be expected.

You have restored the elementals to their rightful place!\nAye, I knew you would come through! Now, allow me to share with you an even more incredible discovery.\nAs I mentioned before, we have discovered that certain songs can trigger specific memories within our aetheric bodies. As before, these songs are shared among all the elementals, and they are especially effective when used together.\nTo trigger a memory, however, one must first imbue the item with the proper emotion. This can be done, of course, but only certain items are capable of doing so.\nAnd now I have discovered a new one─a blessed instrument. A piece of equipment blessed by Nophica, you call it?\nWell, yes, it is indeed a piece of equipment. But where in the world could I have possibly acquired it?\nI cannot help but fear, but there is only so much one can do. I have searched high and low, but my hands are full here.\nShould you ever find yourself in need of an anemone, pray pray seek me out.

I pray you will use this blessed instrument to further enhance your psionic powers!\nNow, while I am honored to share this knowledge with you, I must warn you that this method is not for the faint of heart. It is meant to be used on those who are already deeply bonded with their aetheric bodies.\nI am certain you are already aware of this, but the anemone you have restored has already absorbed some of the dark mage's aura. As such, any further potent emotions must be channeled into a new song before being sung.\nA blessing is no gift to be bestowed lightly, however. Do not take my word for it, however─ask the anemone itself if it would be suitable for you.\nAnd do be aware that while this method is incredibly effective, it does come with a price. While the restoration of an aetheric body is essentially irreversible, the memories it leaves behind may not be so easily forgotten.\nShould you wish to learn more, pray speak with the anemone in front of the restored altar. I am certain it will be there to explain all.', '\nNyell:', '\nShould you ever find yourself in need of an anemone, pray seek me out. I will be there to explain all.']

As such, it has become increasingly difficult to find individuals who can fulfill our needs─and especially those who can perform our instruments.\nWell then, allow me to present you with your reward.\nNow, I have already given you your instrument. As I trust that you know, an instrumental is essentially a device that allows us to capture a certain kind of sound. While these devices vary in function, they all share one thing in common─a certain rhythmic quality that allows the performer to make use of all of the parts of the instrument.\nIn this way, a performer can capture the essence of a piece of music, regardless of the style in which it was composed.\nIn the case of flutes and horns, this quality is best achieved when the parts are played in quick, rhythmic succession.\nBy way of a reward, I have been given the liberty to teach you how to play the flute. I am certain that once you have learned the technique, you will want to apply it to your other instruments, no doubt!\nIn addition to the rewards I have offered you, I am pleased to offer you the opportunity to perform at one of my festivals!

Well, it is a period of unparalleled artistic achievement, during which time the study of all manner of music flourished.\nNot all of it was created equal, of course─there was a time when “divergent styles” were shunned, and performance was limited to performances that bore no relation to what was deemed suitable for a given audience. However, that is not what concerns you today.\nWhat concerns you is the music itself, of course. As I said, it flourished during the “Classical Era,” and it concerns me to see that it is being presented today in the manner it was intended.\nThe piece in question is one of the more familiar pieces from the Requiem, if you must know. It was composed by none other than Franz the Fair, and it was his final piece before he died. It is a piece that has been interpreted by countless artists, from Beethoven to Tchaikovsky.\nAnd while I am by no means a scholar of music, I have an inkling as to what it might be used for.

Thus, in order to fit the music to the needs of today's audience, we must be certain to respect his wishes.\nI think it only fair that you be given the opportunity to perform it in its entirety. I wish you well in your future endeavors.", '\nLuciae:', "\nI cannot wait to hear your rendition of the requiem.

Though its primary function is to enhance the wielder's physical abilities, it can also be used to incapacitate his opponent.\nWhile the Atma–infused Hammer and Atma–infused Blade are meant to be used together, there is no need to worry about which one you will be using when. Any of these tools can be utilized to their fullest potential.\nI should not imagine that the Atma–infused Blade will provide the requisite challenge for you. If anything, you would do well to seek out a partner who is familiar with the technique.\nAnd if you would prefer a more traditional approach, you might also consider a traditional Atma–infused Bow _________________________________________________________________________ Though it bears a striking resemblance to the traditional Atma–infused Bow, the Atma–infused Bow is distinct in that it is an Atma weapon with no connection to the arcane entity.\nIn other words, if you wish to learn Atma, you would do well to seek out a practitioner of the discipline.\nI realize that this may seem like a burden, but as the Atma–infused Hammer and Atma–infused Blade are meant to be used together, any distractions would be well worth avoiding.\nIf you would like to learn more about the Atma–infused techniques, I encourage you to speak with a practitioner of the discipline.

I'm sure my offer of services was warmly received!\nHere's a little something on the house. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask me!\nNow then, let's talk business. We have a team of researchers and clinicians working tirelessly to study the effects of Doman medicine on our fellow Doman.\nThey're making discoveries day and night, and I'm thrilled to be a part of it!\nBut it's not all research. There's so much work to be done if we're to truly understand the effects of the Doman Empire on our homeland.\nThat's why I wanted you to be a part of it, friend. To help us in our endeavor, you'll be working alongside researchers from the Khaleef Research Foundation, one of the largest organizations in Doma.\nI'm sure you've heard of them, but the Foundation also does research into other subjects, such as cloning and metamorphosis.\nIf you have an interest, you could also make use of their facilities. There's nothing better than a nice cold cup of tea─well, except perhaps tea in the cold of outer space!\nAh, speaking of outer space, I should mention that my research is also focused on the idea of life after death. I've got some ideas that may prove of interest to you, so let me know when you're ready to move on."]

Dialogue: ['\nHilmar:', '\nYou look like a fine warrior to me, and I am rarely wrong.\nYou may not have heard of the Victory, but I assure you it is being built to last. The foundation stone was laid this past summer.\nThough I suspect you are eager to see the ship in the water, I would ask that you pay a visit to the dock in Bulwark Hall. A few of the workers are stationed there. If you can spare the time, pray speak with them.', '\nDig Site Chief:', "\nHail sinner well met. My name is Diligent Spirit. I am stationed at the docks here at Bulwark Hall.\nYou're an adventurer, yes? Let us speak of the Victory. I trust you are familiar with the tale? It is said that the Victory was commissioned by Lord Francel, who was Lord of the Rhotano Trade Company.\nUpon hearing that the House of Splendors was seeking a new home for its shipyard, he thought of creating a new nation within Limsa Lominsa. He contacted his old friend, Hingashi Kojin, and together the two men crafted a plan that would see the Victory built here in Ul'dah.\nKojin was born in Kugane, and was a samurai of the Red Clan. He was elected member of the House of Splendors in accordance with Lord Francel's wishes.\nHowever, in the wake of the Calamity─and, I may add, the death of his beloved wife─Kojin became an agitator for the sake of the people of Ul'dah. He helped found the Doman Liberation Front, and played a leading role in the liberation of the Sultansworn.\nWhile he insisted on continuing to work for Hingashi Kojin, he eventually began to question the House's motives. In the end, he decided to join the Doman Liberation Front and fight for Doma.\nHe is currently a Doman citizen and a soldier in the Doman Resistance. It may surprise you that he holds a grudge against the House of Splendors. He refers to it as the organization's "cowardly owner."\nTo compound matters, after much persuasion, he has decided to relinquish his citizenship and renounce his ties to the House. I am told this is to be his final act in public.\nI imagine he will be missed by many in Ul'dah. Please come to the docks and pay your respects. I will not be present, of course. I will be watching from here.", '\nDig Site Chief:', '\nTo compound matters, after much persuasion, he has decided to relinquish his citizenship and renounce his ties to the House.

Dialogue: ['\nBaderon:', "Welcome, sir, to the Baderon Fine Art Gallery. Perhaps you have an interest in fine art, as mine does. Well then, I would be most grateful if you could take a moment to peruse one of my paintings.\nYou will find the subject matter rather familiar─paintings of the purest gold that were once hung in the homes of Ul'dahn nobles. The works are of such beauty that I can scarcely believe my eyes when I behold them now...\n...Ahem. I believe I speak on behalf of the gallery when I say that these paintings are so extraordinary that they cannot be missed. I have no doubt that you will enjoy them as much as I have. \nNow, let us examine the subject matter in question. In so doing, mayhap we may come to understand each other a little better. Yes, that is right. I am telling you about a love affair, you understand.\nI was in a relationship with a man of Ul'dah who was quite taken with the works of art in this room. We were blessed to meet at the Exarch's table when he came to call upon us one day.\nAlas, the art was of an extremely high quality, and it was all he wanted to see. So he bought many of the paintings and brought them to our home. I remember the day well─it was the day we embarked on our first official commission together.\nAfter that, every commission he asked for was a masterpiece beyond compare. I do not think he realized how much he had grown until we had to throw away his entire collection. But to this day, when we speak of their past, he is filled with pride and joy. He is the sort of man who would take the time to explain his feelings to a stranger. \nSo it was at the Exarch's table that I met my husband. I do not suppose he would have been able to recognize me had he not been there to introduce himself.\nAfter the war, he continued to paint beautiful images of Ul'dah and the world beyond. I remember fondly the day we began working together, when we could afford to indulge our passion for fine art.\nI suspect it was that very passion that brought him here to Thal proper, to that very art museum which he helped to found.\nWhen I heard that he had died, I could have hardly believe it. Yet here I am, standing before you, having the opportunity to show my husband's work to someone who has the chance to meet him. I cannot imagine a happier day. \nNow, let us return to the subject of our appointment. I trust you have come to understand what my husband meant to me.\nYes, you will no doubt agree that it is an honor to be able to present his work to someone who has the opportunity to hear him speak.", '\nKokosamu:', "You have come at the perfect time, Forename. I am pleased to say I have a new commission for you.\nI would like you to have this. It is an old painting of mine, but I have rediscovered a new one that I would like you to have.\nIt is a portrait of my dear husband, taken shortly before he was wounded in our last battle. I had it engraved on my heart that he would be fighting beside me until the end.\nIt is a sentiment I will not soon forget. I would be most honored if you were to hang it in your home,
