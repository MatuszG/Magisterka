It'd be best if you could find out for yourself.\nTake this here vase─I've marked the spots where I want you to practice. Once you're done, come and meet me in front of the Archeion.", '\nAdalberta:', '\nSee? I knew you'd find a way.\nNow then, I'd best teach you the steps before we go any further.\nThere are three parts to this basic form: the heel, the step, and the step over.\nThe heel is the most basic and easiest to perform, but it's also the most difficult to maintain when you try to extend your arm out in front of you─think about it from the armpits up.\nThe step is where you take a step forward, then turn your body to the side to bring your knee back to your chest. The step over is a doublet with the foot still on the ground.\n
