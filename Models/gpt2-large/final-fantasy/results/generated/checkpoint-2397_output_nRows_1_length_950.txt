A rare sight in these parts, I'll wager.\nI'm sure you've had your share of scrapes with the law, but ever since the Calamity─and particularly since you helped thwart a plot to destroy Pharos Sirius─people are more willing to overlook the petty crimes.\nThe truth is, most folk are honest folk, and if you ask them what they do for a living, you'll find that most of them will say, “I hunt fish.” That, in fact, is the most common answer.\nYou'll find some who'll even go so far as to say they're fishermen.\nAnd that's about it. Most folk, when asked, will only say that they hunt fish. That's about it.

That's why I want you to take this as a token of my appreciation.\nWhen you return to Gridania, you'll find me at the docks. There, we can discuss the finer points of your exploits.\nAnd...here─your reward, as promised."]

You're the adventurer who helped bring peace to the markets with that package, yes?\nI see... You mean the one who fought the good fight, yes?\nThank you, adventurer. I'm in your debt.\nThe House of Splendors is a favorite of mine─even more so since the Calamity─so I knew I was right to take the initiative.\nUl'dah's a great trading nation, and our merchants are a vital part of the nation's economy. I knew that Mogmont would be interested in the goods in question, so I prepared a letter and delivered it to him.\nI'm sure Mogmont will be pleased to hear that his associate made the right decision, yes? That he would be willing to pay handsomely for your services.\nI hope that this will suffice as payment for your efforts. You've saved the nation a great deal of trouble.\nBut perhaps you'd be interested in joining me in a more ambitious venture? If you have the time, I'm sure I can offer you a great deal more."]
