Dialogue: ['\nWolkan:', '\nWelcome, ally of Ronka. This tavern is just down the way from the Rising Stones.\nYou may have noticed, but our merchant regulars rarely leave. As a matter of fact, they usually stop at this very spot on their way home after a long day of trading.\nBut today, they decided to stop at a local restaurant for dinner, and so we have been charged with making the delivery.\nIf you are familiar with the concept of a “delivery,” I am sure you have heard of it. In this case, the customers are taken to a nearby location where a servant prepares their meals.\nNormally, this would be an affront to our regulars, but they respect the chef so much that they willingly accept his request.\nI will not pretend that our job is easy─it is not.

Indeed, in fact, the opposite is true: the Garleans have served their purpose, and in fact have rekindled the flames of war.\nAnd while we may have made great strides in our fight against the Garleans, there's still much to be done.

I need to speak with you.\nI was about to head back to Red Rim, but I've received word that an airship was seen leaving the port in the northwest.\nThe witness was a woman who was traveling with two friends.

You are, however, an adventurer and I can ill afford to delay you. I would have you travel to Red Rim and investigate the matter with me.\nI realize this is a rather personal request, but may I ask that you inform my friend that I will be along shortly?\nMy friend will not believe me until I show her the corpse, so you must go and speak with her yourself. You can use this lantern to light your way.\nThis is the spot where the airship was sighted. Do not be surprised if you run into trouble. There is a cave nearby. If you should run into any trouble, pray seek me out.\nAh, you have returned. I hope you were not met with too much hostility.\nYou have my thanks. The Calamity changed the land, but it did not change the people here. They are as stubborn as ever, but there is a glimmer of hope in their eyes.\nThis is a small token of what we can achieve if we work together. For as the poet said, 'The wind blows where we stand,\nSo we must go where the airship left,\nSo we must fight the battles that she left,\nSo we redouble our efforts,\nSo we rise again, stronger and redder.']
