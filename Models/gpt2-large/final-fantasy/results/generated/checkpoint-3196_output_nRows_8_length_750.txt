Is there something you wish to know?\n...Something that will ensure the continued survival of Gridania?\nBy placing the seal within the beast's belly, you have ensured that it will not only be there, but will grow stronger.\nThis is indeed a bold move. But I suppose we have no choice─we must do it. If we do not, the imperials will simply release the beast into the wider world.\nYes, this is the only way─and the only option─to ensure that we are protected. I can think of no other.\nForename─may I ask you a question?\nForename, I take it you have read the parchment. Have you considered the alternative? Should the seal be destroyed, the beast will simply re-appear in some other location?\nI cannot imagine a worse outcome. But if we do not act now, the day will come when we cannot protect Gridania.\nWell, I suppose that is as good a time as any. Thank you for your time. I pray that you are able to carry out your tasks in peace."]
