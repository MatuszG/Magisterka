Title: A Bargain Struck
Dialogue: ['\nYs Gyuf:', '\nYou there, traveler! Yes, you! Yes! I need your help!\nYou see, the other day, we were strolling through the Gorgagne Mills when a merchant approached us, asking for a guided tour. He is a rather affable fellow, so I thought it a fine idea to offer him a generous sum of gil.\nBut the merchant has not returned yet! And when he does, I fear he will not be able to walk without assistance.\nI am loath to send you into the midst of danger, but you are a man of great ability and honor, so I will. I would ask you to search for him in the North Shroud.\nMy thanks in advance! I will inform the merchant that you are to search for him in the North Shroud.\nOh, and if you should happen to find him in the North Shroud, please inform him that I sent you.', '\nNorth Shroud Merchant:', "\nWh-Who are you? I said I was looking for a guided tour, not a charity case!\nAhhh, my favorite! Thank you so much! I am in your debt.\nI am told you are the son of one of Ishgard's wealthiest families. What say you? Is there aught I can assist you with?", '\nNorth Shroud Merchant:', "\nA fine family. I have known many wealthy families in my time, but never one as distinguished as yours.\nMy son grew up in Ishgard, but he left to escape the prying eyes of the inquisitors when they came for him.\nHe journeyed here on a trade mission, and was captured by the Garleans when they invaded. Though he spoke no word to anyone, I knew he was being held against his will.\nAfter much persuasion, he finally agreed to speak with me, and I began to research his family tree. I discovered that his great grandfather was a merchant who was once intimate with the Aldenard family.\nI knew immediately that he must be the merchant that my son had been talking about. And I began to research further, learning that his great uncle was a merchant who was once intimate with the Ala Mhigan royal family.\nAla Mhigan royalty was quite wealthy, and they held many offices in the government. But they did not elect a king, as was the case with the Aldenard family.\nI knew from my research that my son's great uncle, being a merchant, could gain access to the royal coffers. And I began to think that somehow, my son had been led to believe that he must find the royal family.\nBut no matter how cleverly my plan had worked, I was not sure how to go about it. I needed someone with royal blood in their veins to help me.\nSo I asked the people of Ul'dah what they knew of the royal family. And they told me that the royal family had been wiped clean─that they all had died, and their children had been placed under the protection of the Maelstrom.\nIt was during this time that the royal family began to fall apart. And as the royal family faded, so too did their influence.\nAfter much deliberation, I finally decided that I must find my son's royal blood, and that I must do it myself. I set out on a journey to gather information, and have been traveling ever since.\nI have been quite successful in my efforts

It's simple─I need you to bring me back some mammoth meat. You'll find some north of Skull Valley, just beyond the bridge.\nThis is for you, of course. It's my job to make sure the clients get their goods, but I'm also here to make new ones. If I don't hunt these mammoths, who will?\nYou're not a client? Well, it ain't for a lack of trying.

Dialogue: ['\nDavyd:', '\nAh, Forename. I have been awaiting your return.\nYou see, word has it you and your merry band have struck a deal with the beastmen. In exchange for the minerals they have on offer, they have promised to spare your people harm should the Calamity come to pass.\nConsidering the sorry state of things in Gridania, it is quite a bargain. And as long as I have known it, I have no reason to doubt their words.\nBut I am no scholar. I have always been more of a practical man. And when it comes to matters of the heart, I find that words are as much a guide as arrows.\nThus I must ask: have you, by word of your own free will, agreed to abide by the terms of the bargain? If so, please do so─I will explain everything in due course.\nThe Calamity wrought a most unexpected change in the land. The earth shook and trembled, and the very earth trembled back. Within a short time, the land was covered with an eerie white coating.\nThe creatures that once made their homes there have since moved on to other lands, never to return. Those that remained behind have not been so fortunate. Many of them have been slain, and their bodies cast into the sea.\nThough we cannot claim to have dealt the creatures a mortal blow, it has made us think twice before doing business with them. I think it prudent to do so now, before a potential conflict between our peoples arises in the future.\nIt is an unfortunate state of affairs, but one we must learn to overcome if we are to prosper in this world. We cannot expect to prosper if we are constantly beholden to the needs of others.\nI believe that by working together, we will be able to overcome our differences and live in peace for many years to come. For that, I thank you. Now, take care. I will see you back at the Dawn Throne.', '\nPopmessage:', '\nYou are under attack!', '\nDavyd:', '\nGood, you are safely returned. What news do you have of the bargain?\n...Yes, everything seems to be in order. I only hope that the Calamity has not backfired on them.\nI imagine that you must be eager to hear the good news. It turns out that not only did you and your band save Gridania from destruction, but you and your fellow adventurers were able to bring a measure of peace back to our people.\nThanks to you, I have reason to believe that there will be no repeat of that which took place five years ago.\nI would like nothing more than to repay you for your kind words, but I am afraid that I cannot. As I said before, words alone will not suffice. It is up to you and your fellow adventurers to put the word out to the people of Gridania.\nDo be careful out there.

There are, what, thirty candidates in our entire family?\nThe more I think about it, the more I realize that my decision has been influenced by my children.\nThey were present during the selection process, but were not chosen. They were not even consulted.\nThat is why I have decided to delegate the selection to you. I would be honored if you could visit our home and see our family for the first time.\nIt is, of course, still entirely possible that my decision will be changed once the official announcement is made. That is, once the Alliance and the High Houses have jointly selected you for the role.\nBut for now, I would be honored if you could come and see us for yourself.

Dialogue: ['\nResistance Councilor:', 'Greetings, Commander. I stand willing and able to aid you in the suppression of the Dravanian Horde.\nIn fact, I have a proposal that may be of interest to you.\nIn exchange for the aid of our allies, we shall offer them protection in exchange for the defeat of their common enemy.\nThis is, of course, contingent upon the councilor agreeing to the terms of the agreement. I trust you are aware of the risks inherent in any potential military alliance, do you not?\n', '\nResistance Councilor:', 'Very well. Our councilor shall convene an ad hoc meeting to discuss the proposal.

I take it you've come at the behest of our councilor?\nAs you are well aware, the battle against the Dravanian Horde is far from over. As such, it is inevitable that some portion of our people will remain on Dravanian soil to ensure that we maintain a presence in the region.\nIt is for this reason that we have established a permanent watch post at Slitherbough. We will remain on alert for any Dravanian activity, and will respond if it occurs.\nGiven the current political situation in the Near Eastern region, however, I am not sure if this is the best course of action. Should you wish to travel between the two locations, you may do so by means of a special pass─this one, for instance.\nLikewise, if you wish to engage in trade with our neighbors, you will need to obtain a permit.\nIt is not as though the Resistance has any shortage of these things, but...as you may have noticed, obtaining them has proven more difficult than we had anticipated.\nIt may be that in the wake of the Calamity, more people have lost faith in the established order. They believe that change is inevitable, and that the existing order is unviable.\nThese feelings are shared by our fellow citizens, but we cannot well express them in words. We must come together, and work together, to overcome our differences─and that is precisely what the Resistance does.\nAnd while the exact nature of your mission will be different from mine, it is likely that you will find the same spirit in dealing with your fellow man. For my part, I have little doubt that you will find it a most enriching experience.\nNow then, let us return to the matter of your mission. I trust you are ready to proceed?\nVery good. I will see to preparing the pass. Once you have it, please make your way to Slitherbough, where our representatives will await.", '\nSlitherbough Resistance Councilor (if present):', 'You are returned, and none the worse for wear, I see.

Had she not been so generous with her time, or perhaps moreso, I would not have welcomed you with open arms.\nBut the Resistance has need of all the help it can muster. We cannot well ignore the possibility that additional people may join the fight against the Dravanian Horde.\nIt is for this reason that I have established this post at Slitherbough.

Dialogue: ['\nResistance Councilor:', 'Greetings, Forename. I am pleased to inform you that the council will be reconvened at your earliest convenience.\nBefore the Resistance took the field, I had hoped to win your support with an ambitious initiative.

Given the Resistance's previous experience, however, we were wary of inviting foreign armies to our doorstep.\nWe had considered several possible locations for our base, but ultimately chose Monzen because of the strong support it received from the local people.\nAlas, we are short on men to man our defenses.
