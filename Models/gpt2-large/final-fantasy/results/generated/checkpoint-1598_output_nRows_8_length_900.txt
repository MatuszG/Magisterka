These are not the first incidents of this nature in recent memory.\nIt is for this reason that we are working feverishly to upgrade our weapons systems. We have already made great strides with regard to our archers and crossbowmen, but we need your help to improve our weapons to the point that they can defeat even the Dravanian archers and crossbowmen.\nThis may seem an inconsequential task at first, but if it is successful, it could prove to be an enormous boon to our war effort.\nI shall assign you a task at once, sir.

Title: A Blissful Arrival
Dialogue: ['\nBlanstyr:', "\nWell met, adventurer. Might I interest you in a bit of work for me?\nA few days ago, a traveler passed through Ul'dah who─ I'll never forget it─looked right at me and asked if I was the one who was going to help her.\nAs I can tell, you're not. I'm afraid you've made yourself quite the odd man out, and that's a problem for me.\nSo I'm going to ask you to help me find her─and you, of course, can help me.\nBut first, let's see here... Oh, this is it! A young girl who looks to be around her age, and she's been wandering around the docks of Nabaath Areng.\nIf you're looking for her, you should head for the docks and take a right here.", '\nBlanstyr:', '\nWell, look at her! She's absolutely radiant! I can't wait to meet her!', '\nNabaathgirl:', "\nHello? Is there something I can help you with?\n...Oh, sorry! I was just...thinking about the docks.\nThe docks are a place where people from across the realm come to make their way to Nabaath Areng. The girl I was hoping to meet is currently here, and she's been asking after you.\nSo I thought I'd ask her if you were going to help her, and she said you should head for the docks. I thought I'd tell her you were here already─which I now realize was a mistake.\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I have to head back to the girl. I'll see you there!", '\nBlanstyr:', '\nSo, did you find the girl?', '\nBlanstyr:', "\nShe's a bit of a loner, I'll grant you that. However, she's actually quite friendly with adventurers.\nAnd I'm sure she was hoping to meet you. I'm sure she knows who you are, and I'm sure she wants to thank you for your help.\nBut enough about her─let's talk about you.\nAs you can see, I'm a bit of an odd man out. It's not because I'm a stranger─I've known you for quite a while─but because I'm not a fighter.\nFor a long time, I thought it was my destiny to be a fighter. But I've since come to realize that's not the case.\nSo I decided to give it up and try my hand at Nabaath machinist. I've been learning the basics of the trade, and I think it's about time I got some experience.\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I have to head back to the girl. I'll see you there!", '\nNabaathgirl:', '\nHello? Is there something I can help you with?', '\nNabaathgirl:', "\n...Oh, sorry!

I'm not sure I get it myself, but I appreciate the sentiment.\nIn any case, thank you for coming, and I hope you'll take time to spend with me again in the future. We'll meet again when the time is ripe!", '\nAlisaie:', "\nI've made the effort to search for a suitable melody, but I can't seem to find one.
