Title: A Bargain Struck
Dialogue: ['\nBraya:', "\nI'm glad you came along when you did. This deal is a lot more interesting than I anticipated.\nI've been studying the ancient texts─especially the section covering the negotiations with the sylphs─and I've come across a rather interesting bit of information.\nApparently, the elder gods spoke with the sylphs in person. Apparently, the sylphs agreed to trade with the elder gods in exchange for the knowledge of certain spells.\nObviously, the gods wanted to know what the magicks of these ancient texts would be like, and what manner of spells they're best suited to.\nAnd from what I've been able to piece together, the sylphs used a peculiar form of magic that was unique to them─a form of summoning magick called alexandrite.\nApparently, the elder gods had been expecting this exchange and thought it a good idea to test their faith in the bargain. And apparently, the sylphs believed the elder gods would be receptive to their request.\nApparently, the elder gods chose the most suitable spell for this exchange based on the wishes of the people of Little Solace─the people who were most likely to have attained peak enlightenment prior to the Flood.\nApparently, the people of Little Solace believed the elder gods would receive visions of the future through their contact with the alexandrite, and this was what they sought to communicate to the elder gods.\nApparently, the people of Little Solace also believed that the alexandrite would be receptive to their requests, and so they pooled their resources and purchased crystals from a merchant who was dealing in crystals in Radz–at–Han.\nApparently, the elder gods were expecting a representative from the Crystal Exarch's party to come to Radz–at–Han to purchase crystals from the merchant.\nApparently, the Crystal Exarch's party also planned to bring alexandrite crystals to the Elder Seedseer in exchange for the knowledge of these ancient magicks.\nApparently, the Elder Seedseer planned to use these crystals to contact the alexandrite to gauge the elder gods' receptivity.\nApparently, the Elder Seedseer planned to use these crystals to gauge the elder gods' receptivity.\nApparently, the Elder Seedseer also planned to collect crystals from the sylphs in exchange for the Elder Seedseer's knowledge of these ancient magicks.\nApparently, the sylphs had also asked for a crystal from the Crystal Exarch's party in exchange for the Elder Seedseer's knowledge of these ancient magicks.\nApparently, the sylphs had also asked for a crystal from the Crystal Exarch's party in exchange for the Elder Seedseer's knowledge of these ancient magicks.\nApparently, the sylphs also asked for a crystal from the Crystal Exarch's party in exchange for the Elder Seedseer's knowledge of these ancient magicks.\nApparently, the sylphs also asked for a crystal from the Crystal Exarch's party in exchange for the Elder Seedseer's knowledge of these ancient magicks.\nApparently, the sylphs also asked for a crystal from the Crystal Exarch's party in exchange for the Elder Seedseer's knowledge of these ancient magicks.\nApparently, the sylphs also asked for a crystal from the Crystal Exarch's party in exchange for the Elder Seedseer's knowledge of these ancient magicks.\nApparently, the sylphs also asked for a crystal from the Crystal Exarch's party in exchange for the Elder Seedseer's knowledge of these ancient magicks.\nApparently, the sylphs also asked for a crystal from the Crystal Exarch's party in exchange for the Elder Seedseer's knowledge of these ancient magicks.\nApparently, the sylphs also asked for a crystal from the Crystal Exarch's party in exchange for the Elder Seedseer's knowledge of these ancient magicks.\nApparently, the sylphs also asked for a crystal from the Crystal Exarch's party in exchange for the Elder Seedseer's knowledge of these ancient mag

The name itself sends a shiver up the spine, does it not? A place so fraught with danger that one need only step outside to be devoured by the ravenous tursuses?\nBriardien has had difficulty in reaching the site in the past, due to the sheer enormity of the beasts that populate it.\nBut now that the threat has been eliminated, the task may finally be accomplished. I would have you ascertain the whereabouts of three claymore fulms─the fulms that were sighted in the immediate vicinity.\nThe fulms were sighted west of the settlement, to the east. If you see them, do not hesitate to act─the lesser fiends will be no match for the Warrior of Light.\nOnce you have the fulms in your sights, return here and deliver them to Brother O–App–Pesi. I will have the others wait for you outside.', '\nO-App-Pesi:', "\nWhat in the seven hells is that thing? I've never seen a fulm this big.\nBriardien sent you?

And as a beekeeper, I've seen it all─I've seen it with my own eyes.\nSo when I heard that a group of folk were setting up hives in the area, I knew that I wanted to be a part of it.\nIt's a way of showing that we─ as a people─are ready to move on from the tragedy that was the Flood. We're ready to live in harmony with nature, and that includes the bees.\nOf course, I'll still require some assistance in setting up the nests, but I'm hoping that a little help will go a long way.

Title: A Bold Decision
Dialogue: ['\nGullinkambi:', '\nI must say, this is a most peculiar development. The mere thought of Ala Mhigo bringing forth a new hero fills me with a sense of foreboding.\nMayhap you have heard the rumors, but the man who will become our next king is an Ala Mhigan exile. Worry not─I can tell you all about him in due time.\nFirst, he journeyed to Doma where he befriended a man named Gundobald.\nAfter a short while, the two decided they wanted a child. A baby. And so they journeyed back to Ala Mhigo, where they found a farm and a cave.\nThere they decided to raise the child there, and there they named the child Hraesvelgr.\nWhen the child was born, Wolekdorf, one of our most esteemed scholars, came to see the child. Wolekdorf thought the child an excellent choice, for it possessed a strength and bravery unlike any of our own.\nHowever, Wolekdorf was not the only one who had an inkling of what was to come. Even after the child had been born, Wolekdorf continued to advise the couple.\nUltimately, the couple decided to have a child of their own in Ul'dah, where they resided until their death.\nI will spare you the details of their journey─it is not important enough to share now. Suffice it to say, it was a most trying time.\nBut before that, let us return to the subject of your question. The king is expected to make a decision by the end of this month.\nMy guess is that he will choose to wait and see how things turn out in Ul'dah before making a decision in Ala Mhigo.\nNow, I realize this is merely speculation, but I have a feeling he will make the right decision. Please wait for me by the entrance to the cave. I will tell you all about it once we are back in Ala Mhigo.', '\nGullinkambi:', '\nPlease wait by the entrance to the cave.

Please wait for me by the entrance to the cave. I will tell you all about it once we are back in Ala Mhigo.', '\nGullinkambi:', '\nSo, Forename, have you decided?\nHmmm. Well, let us see.\nThere is a mountain range to the north called the Ala Mhigan Desert. It stretches for over half a malm to the west.\nThere is also a lake, Lakeland, to the east. The lands are split between the two.\nThe king and his allies will likely want to take their leave of Ala Mhigo before the Garleans take their turn in the region.\nAla Mhigan is not a nation, nor a tribe, but a collection of tribes, each with their own customs and traditions.\nI expect that as time goes on, these differences will narrow, creating a more perfect blend for a nation.\nBut for now, we must focus on what we have in common. And I believe that meeting with Wolekdorf has opened our minds to this.\nNow, as you can see, this is a rather exotic place. I would not recommend traveling to Ala Mhigo for any other reason.\nIt is true that our lands are vast, and that there are many to choose from. However, I believe that by taking the time to understand the people, you will come to appreciate them all a bit more.\
