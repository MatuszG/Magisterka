Dialogue: ['\nHaurchefant:', "\nAh, Forename, I have a very important news to share with you.\nIt concerns a certain Ala Mhigo man named Ser Aymeric.\nHe has recently returned from his honeymoon, and has already begun work on an ambitious plan to unite Eorzea under a single flag.\nA single flag, you say? I've heard of it, but I cannot say I have any inkling as to its true nature.\nI imagine you are curious as to what it might entail. Might I trouble you to speak with Ser Aymeric himself?

As for its purpose, I should imagine that it will serve to unite Eorzea under one flag, and thereby endear us to the Eorzean Alliance.\nI am not sure I can properly express my delight at the prospect. For the first time in the history of our nation, we shall be able to unite in peace and harmony with our neighbors.\nThe nations of the world will flock to our shores, and our people will live in harmony with one another.\nThat, I should imagine, is the very purpose of the flag, and I am honored to be a part of it.\nI cannot imagine what kind of an alliance it will bring, but I should hope it will be worth the wait.\nIn any event, I must hurry to the rendezvous point. There is no time to waste.\nNow, there is but one thing I must do before we begin.\nI need to take the flag into the hands of an Ala Mhigan who is familiar with the flag.\nA soldier, perhaps?
