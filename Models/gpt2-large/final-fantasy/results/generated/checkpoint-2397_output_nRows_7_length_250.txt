Dialogue: ['\nDmitar:', "I see you've been keeping busy, Blade Surname. I see you've been keeping busy─and I speak from personal experience.\nYou see, as a matter of policy, we don't share information with the Empire, which means you're the only person we've been able to turn to for assistance.\nI must say, however, that your efforts have been greatly appreciated.\nI would ask that you speak with our colleague over there if you are willing to aid our cause.\nThat fellow over there is a member of the Convictory's Security Bureau. I would ask that you speak with him if you are willing to aid our cause.", '\nDmitar:', "I see you've already spoken with our colleague? Good, good.\nI'd like to think that with your help, we'll be able to prevent any more needless casualties.\nBut you're not the first to show us that you're up to the task.

Dialogue: ['\nFufucha:', "Ah, Forename. Word of your noble deed has reached me. As you have no doubt observed, the Order of the Twin Adder is in a state of upheaval.\nI speak of course of the recent meeting of the Grand Companies, where representatives from across the realm made their pitch for supremacy.\nAnd while we would never begrudge a fellow member of our order the chance to express his or her desires, we believe that this particular gathering served to underline the urgent need for cooperation.\nThe Holy See has decreed that we must establish an official presence in Eorzea to better coordinate our efforts with the other Eorzean nations.\nI would ask you to travel to the Observatorium in upper La Noscea, where you will find an aetheryte─a crystal capable of resonating with the aetherial currents around the world─and offer the crystal to the captain of the Blue Badgers, Gontrant.\nShould you succeed in doing so, you will have rendered a tremendous service to the Order, and I would ask that you be commended for your efforts.", '

Dialogue: ['\nDmitar:', "We are gathered here today to discuss the resolution that was approved by our council.\nIt is not a new approach, but one which is more measured than the last. Instead of rushing headlong into confrontation with the Horde, we seek to pacify our neighbors while preserving our own borders.\nThis approach has been remarkably successful, and while it would not do to send the Horde to hunt down our allies, it would not do to allow them to prey on our weak.\nWe will need to discuss strategy and tactics in greater detail when we meet in the field. But for now, there is no time like the present. I would like you to meet with me in my stead.\nLet us meet in the western watchtower. The area is teeming with wildlife, so it may take some time before you find an animal to tame.", '\nDmitar:', "I would like you to meet in my stead.

I shall make a valiant effort to help our people in their hour of need.\nHowever, I am unsure of how to go about it. Should I ask of you the aid of our scouts, they may well refuse me out of hand.\nPlease, will you aid me in asking them for aid? If they would help, they will surely say so, and we can continue our efforts with greater ease.\nI would ask that you speak with those who patrol the area east of here.

Dialogue: ['\nCid:', "We may have met once before─I was on hand for the first meeting of the Allagan Research Council, back in the days before the Calamity.\nWe were on good terms at the time, but the council soon became embroiled in a bitter dispute over the resolution of the first Ultima Weapon─a matter that would have far-reaching implications for the future of Allag.\nI am pleased to see that the matter has been resolved, and that we have allies in both the Alliance and the Resistance. But the council must do more─we must press for full cooperation between our research organizations.\nWe have established a new research facility at the Adders' Nest, and have recruited an accomplished researcher to help run it. But, unfortunately, he has been detained by the Empire on suspicion of aiding the Resistance.\nI would like to grant him asylum if possible, but I cannot do so on my own. He must be given the chance to present himself to the council and explain his actions.\nThat is where you come in. I would have you speak with our researcher on my behalf, and see if he can be
