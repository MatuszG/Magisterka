Title: A Bargain Struck
Dialogue: ['\nKokoshu:', '\nAye, I heard tell of the exploits of the masked man─a man who goes by the name “Vorsaileheuloix,” the name by which he is known in Gridania.\nThere was a time when all outsiders to this island─be they man or beast, sin eater or maidservant─were treated with derision and contempt. Yet thanks to the efforts of some few, the status quo has been remarkably amiable, if not entirely selfless.\nYou, however, are not a member of that small band of freedom fighters, are you? I suppose it would only be fitting if you could offer a token of appreciation for your part in thwarting the attempted robbery.\nYou see, a merchant hailing from Gridania has just agreed to purchase an impressive assortment of rare and curious books from the Doman merchant who recently arrived in Ul'dah.\nThe man─whose name I shall not reveal to your unenlightened eyes─is said to be a worldly man of business, and is well acquainted with the intricacies of the local market.\nThe masked man, however, is said to be a master of disguise, and would likely prefer to remain in Ul'dah for at least a time.\nIf you would be so kind as to track him down, I would like you to gather a great many items for me, which I shall then deliver to his residence in Ul'dah.\nI would not be surprised to learn that the masked man is his acquaintance, for in his mind, there is no distinction between friend and foe. And so I would ask that you gather for me everything the man desires, which should include:─', '\nKokoshu:', "\nA masked man? I'm sorry to say I've never seen him before.\nBut I gather you have a rather extensive background─not to mention a rather impressive wardrobe. It would not do to send a confused young man to his death.", '\nKokoshu:', "\nI'm pleased to say that the masked man's wealth is largely in Ul'dah's hands.\nFor his part, he wishes to stay for a time─a sentiment which I share.\nI'm sure he'll return to his home soon enough, and that I'll have plenty of coin to pay his bills. Thank you for your help, friend. I hope this will suffice as a token of our gratitude."]
