Dialogue: ['\nWichard:', "Well met, adventurer. Might you perchance be headed in the direction of the “Bargain Struck”─that tale of late?\nAs it happens, I was recently approached by a merchant─a rather discerning one─who is keen to purchase some rare spices.\nWhat he seeks is the dark matter known as black pepper, which grows in abundance in the swamplands northeast of here.\nWhile I am not at liberty to say where he might find it, I can only say that he was most effusive in his praise─as was my obliging client.\nA small gesture, but a worthwhile one. Here is his payment, as promised.\nTell me, were you able to acquire the pepper?\nWonderful! I would be most grateful for any assistance you can offer.\nThe area abuts the ruins of Nabaath Areng─a temple dedicated to the worship of the Amalj'aa, or “the Scions of the Seventh Dawn.” It was built by the Amalj'aa themselves, centuries ago.\nThe ruins date back to the latter Belah'dian Era, and house the Amalj'aa's former trophy, the “Bargain Struck.” It was a gift from the Amalj'aa themselves, when they invaded Dravania and laid claim to the entirety of the southern half of the peninsula.\nI will wager that if it were not for the timely intervention of the Immortal Flames, the Victory and her sister ships would have been destroyed long ago.\nI should mention at this point that, while we are able to procure most things from the outside world, we must always be prepared to forage for ourselves.\nIn particular, we must be prepared to trade with the black-hearted beasts known as the Amalj'aa.\nThat said, I am pleased to report that my client was impressed with our progress, and wished to extend his offer to include a larger selection of spices.\nIn the bargain, you have my gratitude as well. When the time comes, I hope you will be able to make use of this new access to the spice trade.\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I have prepared a gift for my client. I hope it suits his fancy."]
