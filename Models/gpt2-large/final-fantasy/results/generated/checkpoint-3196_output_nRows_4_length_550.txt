Dialogue: ['\nBertliana:', "I was about to deliver a gift to a friend in Limsa, but it seems her plans have changed. She's been invited to the Sapphire Avenue Exchange, where she'll be dealing in─you guessed it─crystals.\nWhile I can't say for certain that she'll be interested in the crystals, she is, I suppose─and I do mean always. She's always been obsessed with them, and I'm sure she simply means to buy them.\nI can tell it's not a coincidence that she's decided to make her purchase in Limsa Lominsa. If you're willing to look into it, you'd be a wise choice.\nIt's not the easiest thing in the world to buy and sell crystals, but I've no doubt that Bertliana can manage it somehow.\nI just pray she doesn't end up buying more than she needs. Or that someone else dares offer her more than she's willing to pay..."]

The air here is permeated with a peaceful, if somewhat faint, aroma─think of it as a perfume.\nThe reason for this is simple: a shipment from Ishgard arrived here a while ago, and I've been patiently awaiting its arrival.\nIt's a vital piece of military equipment, and I'm glad it's here. If you wouldn't mind taking it to the field, I'd like you to collect its scent for me.\nThis is the Maelstrom's newest airship, and its arrival marks the beginning of a new era for the Grand Companies.\nBut I can't wait for it to arrive. And I won't─I need it now. So while you're out there, I want you to bring me that scent.\n", '\nBran:', "\nForename, please bring me that scent from the Maelstrom airship. I need it now!", '\nBran:', '\nOh my, that was wonderful! Thank you so much.\nI always smell that way when soldiers leave. It reminds me of all those wonderful meals I had as a child.\nI still haven't quite gotten used to the smell, but it's nice to know it's there. I wonder when I'll get used to it.\nAnyway, thank you again for bringing me that scent. It means the world to me. Now I can finally get back to work.\nYou're a very kind man, Forename. Would you be able to accompany me on my next mission? There's something I need to discuss.']

Dialogue: ['\nAlys:', "Oh, dear. If you've a moment, I'd like to...have a word with you.\nYou know, I've been thinking about what you told me in your letter. About how you wanted to be alone, and...and how you wanted to cry.\nAnd, well, I suppose I can relate. As much as it pains me to admit it, I've been too busy to be of service to anyone in Radz–at–Han.\nSo I'm thinking I'll─<sigh> I'll─help you. I'll─<gasp> I'll draw water from the well and give it to you.\nPlease, come and find me. I'll be waiting for you outside.", '\nAlys:', 'Come back already, you little troublemaker!', '\nAlys:', "There you are! Do you have a bottle of water?\nOh, thank goodness! I've been so worried about you─about how you'd behave if I saw you. I've been trying to encourage you, but it seems I've pushed you too hard.\nThis well is meant to draw water from the mountain, but it's been so long since anyone has used it...\nIf you'll excuse me, I've─<sigh>─needed to take a break from drawing water. Do you mind if I come back to it later?\nThank you again for your help. I hope to the gods it brings you good health and good fortune.\nOh, and before I forget─here is your payment. Now I'm off to draw water."]

Dialogue: ['\nFalkbryda:', "Welcome, traveler, to the Quicksand. If you wish to purchase aether, I suggest you first speak with my husband, Erik, over in Sweetsieve.", '\nErik:', "Well, if it isn't my wife! I'm afraid I've been all up and left my wife.", '\nFalkbryda:', "Oh, you must be confused. My husband and I have always made it a point to buy our wares only to have them stolen the moment we set them down. But as far as I know, you haven't encountered any trouble.", '\nErik:', 'No? Well, we should have been able to buy as much as we wanted...assuming our guards weren't so silly as to steal it away when we didn't ask for it. Anyway, here is your reward─as promised.', '\nFalkbryda:', 'I will have to arrange for more shipments to be sent out in the near future. Once you have learned to harness the power of the aether, you should be able to begin exploring what it means to live in a world without borders.']
