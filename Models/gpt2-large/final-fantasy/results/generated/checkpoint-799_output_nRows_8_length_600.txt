The Amalj'aa have taken a liking to Severian.\nThey say that he is the only man capable of taking care of the Amalj'aa, and they have a plan to make him their leader.\nThey have a plan, but it is far from being perfect.\nFor example, the Amalj'aa plan to use the mining resources in the region to build a new city.\nBut if the Amalj'aa do not succeed, they will have to turn to other means.\nTheir new home will not be built with the same resources as the Amalj'aa. They will have to find a different way to get what they need.\nBut I do not think that is what Severian is thinking. He sees the Amalj'aa as a threat, and he does not want to see them in a new home.\nThe Amalj'aa are no longer welcome here, and we will not
