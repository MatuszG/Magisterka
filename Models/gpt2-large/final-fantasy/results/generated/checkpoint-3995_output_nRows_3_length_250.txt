My lord Forename, pray accept this as a token of my gratitude.\nI was preparing to make the journey to attend the funeral of my lord husband, only to find that my chocobo, Slugger, was sick.\nSlugger is a trained chocobo, but he has been out of commission for some time. At the time of his passing, he was last sighted traveling to the Central Shroud.\nIf it is not too much to ask one of your experience to travel to the Central Shroud and see if Slugger might have caught a chill, I would be most grateful if you could search for him along with my other chocobo, Comet.\nI know I am asking a lot of you, but please search in my stead. I know he would want you to find him.', '\nSlugger:', '\nKweh!\nKweh! Kweh kweh!\nKweh kweh kweh! Kweh kweh kweh kweh!

Very good. We will soon be departing for the site of your trial. While you are waiting, I shall prepare a song for the occasion.\nThe song is a requiem for the instrument you just used. It tells the tale of an alchemist's anguish at the hands of his nemesis, the tempestuous winds of Calamity.\nThe melody is simple and direct, and it perfectly evokes the sense of hopelessness and despair that our victims feel when subjected to the effects of our instruments of torture.

Dialogue: ['\nHugubert:', "My lord Forename, a moment of your time. I would share with you an experience which has brought me to my knees. It is but a few years since I was blessed with a fine gold instrument, which I have since discarded in favor of a more durable piece. At the time, I had no idea that my decision would end in this way. However, that is not to say it is entirely out of character. In fact, I had quite a discussion with my friend regarding the matter, and he convinced me that it was not out of choice, but rather a matter of necessity. He said that in order to make the best use of my instrument, I would have to part with it─if only in a very small way. The object in question is a type of crystallized bone, which is found throughout the world. In exchange for this, certain plants will grow which will enhance the instrument's properties. In my case, this means the extraction of gingko leaves, which can be found growing in the deserts of central Thanalan. You will find these to the west of the Accensor Gate.
