As you may have gathered from the rather lengthy letter I recently received, my master's efforts to breed a more effective variety of honeybee have come to naught.\nInstead, he has been forced to revert to the method of natural selection favored by our forebears, namely, the culling of the most prolific hives.\nAnd, given the current climate, that means fewer of our beloved pollinators will be around to provide a bountiful harvest when the next crop of nectar is due to be picked.\nI, however, believe a more inventive solution to this particular problem lies in the hive itself. I would have you construct a hive out of a single large-celled flower, namely, the honeybeeweed.\nYou'll find the plant in abundance just to the north of Camp Tranquil─I imagine the bees will fly to it forthwith, eager to pollinate the nectar.\nOnce you have constructed the hive, bring it to me, and I will see to its disposition.", '\nKokosamu:', '\nI have constructed a new hive of the honeybeeweed, and have made arrangements for its transportation to Camp Tranquil.

You're a bona fide hero, my friend.\nAs you've doubtless noticed, the poachers we've hired are all but-defunct, meaning they're no longer fit to protect our interests.\nIn fact, a single poacher alone costs us a fortune in food and supplies─far more than we could ever hope to earn from selling arms.\nWe'll need to find new ways to make a living if we're going to keep up with our new outpost's needs. And that means looking outside the realm of the poachers themselves.\nSo if you can help by stopping a single poacher, you could be saving lots of food and money. Well, that's certainly an option."]

Dialogue: ['\nDmitar:', "Let us keep the Alliance together, Blade Surname.\nAs we speak, the Eorzean Alliance makes significant strides toward realizing the full potential of its member nations.\nIn fact, if we are to realize our potential, it is essential that we do not shirk our responsibilities as allies.\nAnd with the Alliance working to fulfill its founding promise, it is only right that we fulfill our part of the bargain, namely, by joining together to take decisive action when the time is ripe.\nThat time is now. The time is now to send the Alliance a clear message: the time is now to unite.\nLet us begin with the East Aldenard Alliance.\nEstablishing a presence in the region will go far in strengthening the Alliance's reputation, and it would not do to see the Alliance's efforts fall to waste.\nWe will send a representative to the summit to represent the East Aldenard Alliance.\nYour presence at the summit is a clear signal to the Alliance that the time is now to unite, and the Alliance will take any initiative necessary to achieve this goal.\nAt the same time, the Alliance will need to communicate its intent to the other member nations.\nTo that end, we have prepared a set of hand-delivered letters which we will deliver to the leaders of the other member nations. The hand-delivered letters are designed to explain the Alliance's intent and the steps it will take to realize it.", '\nEstinien:', 'We have formed a close bond with the Eorzean Alliance.

For this, we must needs unite, and for this, we must needs act together.', '\nKrile:', "The Eorzean Alliance is at war. It is in our mutual interest that the other member nations join forces to combat the Empire.\nEstinien and I are in constant contact with the High Command, and we are regularly provided with intelligence on the Empire's movements.\nIt is for this reason that I would see you present to the other leaders of the Alliance the Alliance's resolve to drive the Empire from our lands.\nYou will be meeting with the leaders of the other member nations, yes? Then let us make our preparations.\nI will see to preparations for the Alliance's arrival in the western highlands.\nI will see to preparations for the Alliance's arrival in the western highlands.", '\nEstinien:', 'I shall see to preparations for the Alliance's arrival in the eastern highlands.\nI shall see to preparations for the Alliance's arrival in the eastern highlands.', '\nKrile:', "I will see to preparations for the Alliance's arrival in the northern highlands.\nI will see to preparations for the Alliance's arrival in the northern highlands.", '\nEstinien:', "I shall see to preparations for the Alliance's arrival in the southern highlands.\nI shall see to preparations for the Alliance's arrival in the southern highlands.", '\nK
