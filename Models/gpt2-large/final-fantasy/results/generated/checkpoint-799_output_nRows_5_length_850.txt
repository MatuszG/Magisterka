I'm looking for someone who can make a delivery to the man who's been named our ambassador.\nHe's an alchemist at the Quarrymill. He's a bit of a busy man, so I doubt he'd be able to spare the time to deliver it himself.\nPlease, go and ask him what he can do for you. I'm certain he'd be more than happy to share with you.", '\nAlchemist:', '\nI am an alchemist at the Quarrymill. Please ask the adventurer what he can do for you.

It's a bit stronger than I usually drink, though, so it's best to drink it in moderation.\nYou see, the ambassador had the idea to set up a research facility here in Ala Mhigo. But the problem was that it would have been impossible to find someone to commit to the cause if the man's name was not so well-known.\nSo the adventurer decided to name the building the name of a famous hero─the hero who saved his people from the Calamity─and the name is the name of his wife.\nWe're hoping to make her proud, but I don't think she'd be able to forgive herself if her husband lost his life saving her from the Calamity.\nI can't wait to hear her story! I know I will! Thank you so much, adventurer!\nPlease, let me know when you have finished drinking!"]

I've developed a new technique, and I need your help with its development.\nIt is a technique that has the potential to improve the lives of many in the region.\nThe technique is called the Falcon Strike, and it is comprised of a series of strikes that can be used against dragons.\nIt is my hope that you will learn to use the technique, and that you will be able to help me bring peace to the world.\nPlease, go and speak with my colleague at the Lancers' Guild. He will be glad to see you.", '\nH'naanza:', 'My colleague is in the Lancers' Guild. Please, go and speak with him.', '\nWidman:', "Hm? You're looking for H'naanza?\nH'naanza's still here, then?\nSo I've heard all about you. I suppose it's time we started talking about you, too.\nWe've been asked to study the way that dragons use their flight to strike.\nAnd it turns out that, like all dragons, they use their flight to strike. But instead of using their wings to strike, they use their tails to strike.\nThe difference, however, is that their tails are extremely sharp, and it would be ideal to hit them with these strikes.\nI think it'd be best if you could deliver those strikes to the dragons.\nThis is a trial, after all. It is not for the faint of heart, but if you are willing to try, I would be most obliged."]
