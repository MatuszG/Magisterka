Dialogue: ['\nSeverian:', "\nSo you've made it here with all your might, and then you've come to the conclusion that you would like to join the fight!\nWell, I'm glad to see it─the fight is the most exciting thing I've ever had the pleasure of doing.\nI've always dreamed of fighting alongside my fellow man, but I've never had the chance.\nBut now that you've made your way here, you may have the chance to do so. I think you'll find it a most enlightening experience.\nThere are two places to start: the first, the Camp Dragonhead, is a small village to the east. You'll find the Garleans there, and they will not tolerate anyone who wishes to assist the Alliance.\nThe second, the Scions' Den, is a large and impressive compound. A lot of adventurers have been drawn to it, and I would not be surprised to hear that the Alliance has recruited adventurers for its ranks.\nIf you would not mind joining us for a short time, I would be more than happy to welcome you.\nI would be honored if you would come with me. I am Severian, one of our finest knights, and the head of the Scions' Den.\nLet us begin at the Camp Dragonhead.\nThe place has been abandoned for some time now, and it would be a shame if all the refugees and the Alliance leaders were forced to stay here for longer.\nThe Scions' Den is a great place, and I am happy to welcome you there.\nNow, if you would not mind, I would be more than happy to welcome you to our camp.
