I am Meffrid, a traveling entrepreneur.\nI recently finished setting up shop in Reunion. The place is bursting at the seams with every kind of merchandise that a traveler could desire.\nAnd I've just now finished adding a few new items to the store─pardon the pun. “A few new items,” I say. Not many, but I'm sure you'll agree.\nI've been asked to name the new wares, but I fear it may give the wrong impression. For one, these are not your run-of-the-mill items. All are crafted with the utmost care, from the delicate to the sublime.\nOf course, you will not see these named items in person. They will be delivered to your guild account, as was the case with the other commissions I've been posting.\nPlease allow me a moment of your time to explain the process.\nWhen you first walked through the doors of Reunion, I wasn't sure what to make of you. You are a well-traveled man, you say?\nAnd you're not a traveling entrepreneur any longer, are you? Well, that is very kind of you to agree to be my guest.\nNow, let's get right to it. Here is the new merchandise I've added to the store. And I'll be very specific about what it is that I want you to get.\nFirst things first, I'd like you to see for yourself. Take these earrings, for example. They are made from the skin of a jaculus horn. The fine detail is achieved through the use of finely ground crystals.\nWhen I put the pieces together, I feel a twinge of sadness, as if I've lost something I've loved. But that's not the case. For the rings I make, I go to great lengths to ensure that they will last a lifetime.\nWhen I see the clients walk through Reunion, I feel as if I've been transported back to the scene of my birth. I couldn't have done it better myself.\nNow that you've seen the earrings, would you mind taking them to the woman who commissioned them? I can guarantee that she will be pleased.", '\nMeffrid:', "\nYou've returned! And none the worse for the wear, I see. That is a welcome change.\nI'm pleased to have added to the ever-growing stock of commissions at Reunion. Of course, I wouldn't be doing my job if I wasn't making new ones, you understand.

My thanks to you, friend!\nIt has been some time since last I wore this garb, and it is only fitting that it be honored by one so distinguished.\nIt was not easy choosing between the two outstanding options, but I feel that the Horizon galleon is the clear choice.\nI should be most honored to be granted the honor, but I worry that my choice may come to naught. That is why I must ask you to help me prepare my speech.\nI will begin by sharing with you an account of my life and times. It is meant to serve as a primer for your own journey as an Ea.\nYou will be surprised by what I have to share. Though I knew I wanted to tell this tale once my term as Grand Company member had ended, it seems I may have occasion to speak further of my days on the battlefield.\nThough I was a member of the Seventh Dawn for only a few short months, I was a battle-hardened veteran by the time we met at the Crystarium. Even so, I find it remarkable that I was able to contribute so greatly to the liberation of Ala Mhigo.\nAla Mhigo was a largely forgotten backwater of the Empire. The few who remained behind were branded traitors and driven out into the wilds.\nEven after the Calamity struck and Ala Mhigo was liberated, our unit was still stationed there, albeit under the watchful eye of the Maelstrom.\nWe understood the importance of maintaining a presence in the region, but we also had the feeling that our purpose was destined to be fulfilled elsewhere.\nWhen the time came for me to make the ultimate sacrifice, however, I had no doubt that our purpose would remain intact.\nI would share with you an account of my final mission, but first I must needs finish speaking with my fellow Ea.\nWhen I finished speaking with them, I felt as though I had awoken from a slumber deep within.\nAnd then I felt as though I had awoken, for these feelings were shared by all of us─the heroes of the past and present, united by our shared dream of delivering Ala Mhigo from the darkness.\nOur purpose is no less than the liberation of Ala Mhigo. This is not a sentiment that can be easily discarded, of course. Indeed, it is one of the very reasons why I was chosen for this role.\nBut in telling this story, I am also striving to inspire others to take up the fight against the Ixal
