We'd be fools not to try, but we're not going to succeed.\nYou see, honeybees are territorial, and while we try to avoid conflict, there's no reason why we can't also be friends. But as you've undoubtedly noticed, a fight between two bees is always going to end with one of them injured.\nIn fact, if our entire population were to be wiped out, there'd be no bees left to pollinate any more flowers. Needless to say, this isn't a feasible option.\nThat's why we decided to take a more hands-on approach. Rather than attempting to eliminate the entire species, we decided to focus on one of the most aggressive—and thus, the most deserving—of the creatures.\nAs you've undoubtedly noticed, bees are incredibly clever, and they've managed to adapt to an increasingly harsh environment. Thus, it's only a matter of time before they find a way to adapt to our presence as well.\nIn fact, one of my colleagues was so impressed with their intellect that he asked me to teach them.\nI can't wait to get started...but first, I must needs find the courage to get on my knees.\nA humble prayer for luck, eh?\nMy thanks, friend. I'll make it worth your while.\nNow then, let's get to work.
