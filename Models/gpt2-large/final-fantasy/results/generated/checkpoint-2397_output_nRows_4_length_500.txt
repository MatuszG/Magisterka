Dialogue: ['\nHinuvali:', "\nAh, welcome to Doma. I am Hinuvali, a proud resident of the Twelveswood.\nYou will be pleased to know that Doma is now home to a new and improved pub. The Tap is now serving a variety of fine ales and spirits, and it is my hope that this expansion will allow us to offer a more welcoming and welcoming atmosphere to all who come to Doma.\nI would also like to thank the Doman noble who helped to found Doma.

If you are ever to meet him, I would suggest you seek him out at the Tap.", '\nMarui:', '\nHinuvali and I are both honored to be of service to the Doman noble. I am told you are an accomplished alchemist. We have much to discuss, but I think you will find it enlightening.\nYou will be pleased to know that we are working to revitalize the Tap.

Dialogue: ['\nAdalberta:', '\nAh, Forename! You must be the one they call “the “firstborn,” yes? Well, I have a favor to ask of you.\nI was headed back to the Wonders after a day of research when a flock of migratory waslets caught my eye. I know not their exact migratory path, but I was hoping to spot one somewhere along the route─something like “a “gliding ” might work.\nBut alas, they were nowhere to be found. I was so discouraged, I nearly gave up and walked back alone.\nWould you mind tracking down some of the fledglings and returning with a few specimens for me? I cannot leave the Wonders unattended for long─the wasps are so feisty!', '\nAdalberta:', "\nI would go myself, but I'm sure the wasps would tear me limb from limb for daring to leave the nest. See for yourself if they're lurking near the Wonders.", '\nAdalberta:', '\nThe wasps you're after are likely to be found near the Wonders. See if you can find one, and bring me back some specimens for me.', '\nAdalberta:', "\nYou've returned! And not a single one of the wasps was found near the Wonders. Hmmm... No, I must have been too reckless.\nI must confess, I was beginning to lose my patience with them. I had hoped that the arrival of these beautiful creatures would inspire awe and wonder, not torment and terror.\nYet they have brought neither.\n...What? You think the wasps have something to teach us? That they will one day cause us harm?\n...In that case, I must at least listen to them. You have my sincerest gratitude, Forename!"]

Dialogue: ['\nPassionatesoldier:', "\nI've come to offer you my assistance in the investigation of a recent incident.\nIt was a routine patrol of the area when I noticed a suspicious individual fleeing in a direction away from the main settlement. Upon approaching him, however, he dropped a large amount of crystal dust upon us─a sight I would never have been able to see from here.\nIt was a gift from one of the residents─one of many gifts from the citizens of Little Ala Mhigo─and I was curious to see what it could be used for. I immediately sent word to the settlement, hoping to receive aid from the locals, but it seems that all I received was scorn.\nI understand that this is a difficult time for the settlement, and I understand how destitution can lead to isolation. But I would ask that you do something to show that you care. I would like to know if there is anything you can offer the people.", '\nPassionatesoldier:', '\nI would ask that you search for a crystal somewhere in Little Ala Mhigo. The dust is scattered all over the place, but I would like to know if there is anything you can offer the people.', '\nPassionatesoldier:', '\nWere you able to find something?', '\nPassionatesoldier:', '\nMy, that is a large amount. Thank you.\nI am curious to know what the dust is for. It seems to be some sort of currency or token. I shall make inquiries as soon as I am able.', '\nPassionatesoldier:', '\nWere you able to find anything?', '\nPassionatesoldier:', "\nHmmm, this is a nice surprise.\nI had been expecting someone like you, someone who shares my passion for the law.\nThat is why I was so surprised when you instead turned your back on me and fled with the crystal.\nI am still shaking from the experience. Thank you again for your help."]

Dialogue: ['\nHien:', '\nAh, Master Surname. If it please, I would discuss a recent development with you.\nSeveral days ago, a group of Amalj'aa refugees passed through the Gate of Nald to the northeast. They were last spotted making camp in a small clearing in the northeast corner of the settlement.\nAlas, the camp's location meant that no one had noticed they had arrived, and the Amalj'aa had no intention of bothering us with a prolonged and protracted search.\nIn fact, they were so confident of victory that they told us not to worry─they would simply sweep the area to the northeast of here.\nThat is why, at the urging of our scouts, we went ahead and assigned a party to patrol the area in the meantime.\nHowever, they were ambushed by a band of bandits who ambushed them from ambush. The bandits were killed by one of our own, and the group scattered in confusion.\nWe have assigned a new party to patrol the area in the meantime, and asked that you join them. If you would be willing to help in this matter, please go and speak with R'ashaht Rhiki at the church to the northeast of here.', '\nR'ashaht Rhiki:', '\nGreetings, Master Surname.

Were you able to find any bandits?\n...Hien sent you to help, yes? I have assigned the patrol party a wide search of the area to the northeast.\nI would appreciate it if you would inform them that it is to be a long and arduous journey ahead, and that they should expect the worst.", '\nR'ashaht Rhiki:', '\nAh, you are returned. Do you have a message for me?', '\nR'ashaht Rhiki:', "\nA bandit in the northeast corner of the settlement? I have assigned the patrol party a wide search of the area to the northeast.\nI would

You look like you've done some good for the village with what you've brought.\nYou see, I'm looking for a good lad to help me with a farm operation.\nIt's the work of a veteran such as myself, but I'm still finding it a bit tiring. So I'm hoping someone like you, who's never faced such hardship, will be willing to lend a hand.\nI know I'm asking a lot of you, but there's no one else I can trust with this.
