Dialogue: ['\nWanderingminstrel:', "\nWelcome back, my friend. I've been asked to share with you a most remarkable discovery.\nIt concerns one of the most powerful magicks I have ever seen. It is, however, only within the past few days that I have been able to acquire a sample of its essence.\nYou see, the scholar who discovered it was working under the auspices of the Order of Nald'thal, a faction of the Temple Knights that rose to prominence during the Calamity.\nThe Order of Nald'thal has been trying to seize control of the magicks it has recovered, but I fear that the Temple Knights have no intention of relinquishing control.\nIf the Temple Knights are to be believed, the magicks discovered by Waidar will prove to be the key to the restoration of Ishgard.\nI speak of the Elder Seedseer, the leader of the Order of Nald'thal. While he has been at the helm of the Temple Knights, he has also been leading the effort to recover the Elder Seedseer's magicks.\nFor his part, the Seedseer has been seeking to acquire the magicks he has recovered from the fallen. He has been traveling the realm in search of such magicks, and I fear that he has yet another encounter with the traveler you seek.\nI must warn you, however, that the Seedseer is a difficult character to track down. I have no doubt that you are already aware of this, but I do wish to know of your first encounter with him.\nIf you would meet him in the Brume, you will find him by the entrance to the Brume.\n", '\nWanderingminstrel:', '\nIf you would meet him in the Brume, you will find him by the entrance to the Brume.', '\nWanderingminstrel:', "\nAh, there you are. Tell me, did you come all the way to the Brume to meet the Seedseer?\nHmmm. The Seedseer is a rather interesting character, but I must admit I never saw him before. I see now why he has been traveling the realm in search of these magicks.\nI suppose he must have encountered you in the Brume. He should be expecting you.", '\nWanderingminstrel:', "\nHow did you find him? I take it you have some knowledge of the Seedseer's whereabouts.\nHmm. He has not yet found the Elder Seedseer's magicks, but I imagine that he will soon. He has a rather peculiar way about him, as you can see.\nI must confess I am not entirely certain what my encounter with the Seedseer means for the future of Ishgard. Should he come to possess the magicks he seeks, it is likely that the Seedseer will become the new leader of the Temple Knights.\nI must be ready for that eventuality, or I shall not be the one chosen to lead the Temple Knights.\nAs for you, Forename. If you have any further information concerning the Seedseer's whereabouts, I shall share it with you. I hope that you will not hesitate to speak with him again."]

I must go there and see what can be done to save it.\nBut the great bellow─it was as if you had a hand in it! You are the adventurer, yes?
