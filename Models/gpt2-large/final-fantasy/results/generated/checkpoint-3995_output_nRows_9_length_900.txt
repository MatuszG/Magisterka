If you would be so kind as to visit me, I would be most obliged if you could pick up a bottle of my special wine.", '\nBaderon:', "\nIt's no exaggeration to say that my customers come here to sample every sort of cuisine─from the sublime to the utterly disgusting─that I can think of.\nAlas, I cannot refuse a request from a gentleman like yourself, so I'll be needing you to fill my empty bottle.\nIt all goes back to that business about wares─I can't allow myself to be caught up in the minutiae. If I'm to be honest with myself, I've gotten quite good at picking out the odd wares that other people will find utterly objectionable.\nThe wine you've brought me is one such product. As I said, it's a special creation, and it's my hope that it will brighten the spirits of my doubly devoted customers.\nI'd be most obliged if you could take the bottle to my associate at the Sapphire Avenue Exchange and pour it in. Wishing her well, I'd be ever so grateful...", '\nSerendipity:', "\nPardon the imposition, but I'm afraid I've been all set for a glass of wine.\nOh, it's Baderon! I was so pleased to see you again! I was about to cry─you've done so much for my soul!\nYou have my thanks, friend! I can't tell you how many times I've wailed out to my customers: “How can I possibly serve them such exquisite wares, when I refuse even to serve them myself!?\n<sigh> It's all well and good to dream, but unless someone actually does it, there's nothing to be done.\n...What am I saying? It's not like I was looking forward to working with you! I'm afraid I've just given up."]

Then you have no doubt come across the ubiquitous pests that roam just outside the city gates.\nNow before you go thinking that simply putting these flying beauties on the ground will solve our problem, you may wish to keep in mind that simply putting the creatures on the ground will likely make things worse. A well-laid plan, I say!\nThe bramblycosmoids we require can be found at the Bugarium in Ul'dah. You are welcome to wait in line while I procure the rest.\n", '\nVarthon:', "Ah, Forename. I take it you have the bugs I seek?\nExcellent! I will get to work immediately!\nYou may be surprised to know that this is but one small portion of the total composition I require.

I take it the bugs I ordered arrived just as I suspected.\nYou may be wondering why the concoction we are attempting to create is called a “beeautiful plan.” Simply put, it is a last-ditch effort to save our fallen comrades from certain ruin.\nAt the heart of the solution lies a substance known as a “beeautiful adjuvant.” It is a byproduct of the arthropods' naturally occurring defense mechanism, namely, the secretion of a compound called pungent glandulicidal acid.\nWhen inhaled, this adjuvant causes severe burns to any exposed skin it comes into contact with. Inhalation of this mixture results in an instantaneously painful burn that can be fatal if not dealt with early on.\nNeedless to say, this is a highly dangerous concoction to produce and maintain. I wouldn't suggest trying it at home, even if I were you.\nNow, the question is: what are we going to do with this concoction?\nAfter a lifetime of being forced to live amongst the creatures of the Twelveswood, I find myself at a loss as to how to dispose of it.\nI can think of several possible solutions, but surely there is no better option than toying with death itself?\nI realize the sentiment is somewhat...less than appealing, but we have no choice─it is what we must do.\nAt any rate, I trust you now have something to chew on while I am at work. I hope the experience wasn't too troublesome.\nOh, and before I forget, the concoction I made will be delivered to the troops at Camp Broken Glass. Take care, and godsspeed.", '\nVarthon:', "You should be well pleased with the results of your efforts.\nIn fact, I would say you're already halfway there.\nYou may be wondering why I would entrust the creation of this concoction to you. Well, when one considers the amount of effort it would require to produce a single bottle, it makes sense.\nIn any case, I can think of no better solution to this dilemma. I cannot wait to see what manner of horrific burns and stings will result from inhaling this concoction.\nOh, and before I forget, the troops at Camp Broken Glass are expected to receive this concoction as soon as it is ready. I hope that they will not hesitate to take it upon their soldiers."

Alas, we neglected to mention the most obvious solution─we should move them to an area where they would be less likely to be attacked.\nThe archaeornis were moved to the southeast of here. Unfortunately, the area is teeming with archaeornis, making it difficult to administer the change.\nIf you could see your way to the southeast of here, I would be ever so grateful.

Then I have a proposition that I would make absolutely clear: If you're to be our partner, we must needs have a method for detecting your aetherial signature.\nAs you may already know, Ishgardian scholars have long been concerned with the possibility of life beyond our star. To that end, we have constructed a device which can detect the presence of living creatures.\nIt operates on the principle of “beaking”─detecting the presence of a living being by the way it moves. In the case of this particular Aethernet, that would mean moving it about.\nNow, I realize that this is a rather drastic step. For one, you risk upsetting the equilibrium of the aetherial balance within our star. And two, you are asking us to construct a device which, by virtue of its physical being, can penetrate the earshot of creatures five times its size. Neither of these qualifications are particularly appealing, I should think.\nI would rather not have to ask this of you, of course─but perhaps you might consider offering your assistance to the Ala Mhigan Resistance in their search for a means of detecting life beyond our star.\nI would be most grateful if you could offer your assistance to the Ala Mhigan Resistance in their search for a means of detecting life beyond our star.", '\nKishiligh:', '\nIf you would offer your assistance to the Ala Mhigan Resistance in their search for a means of detecting life beyond our star, pray speak with Kishiligh again.', '\nKishiligh:', "\nWell, I see you've offered your ear to the proposition.\nI must confess that I had rather...disappointed you. For one, I thought we might be forced to part with our device because of budget constraints.\nBut on the contrary, I think it may be more important for our cause than ever that we preserve it. For should our plan prove to be successful, it would mark the beginning of a new era in which Aethernet and all other similar devices are no longer necessary.\nYou see, with the advent of the Seventh Umbral Era, all barriers between our star and the aetherial realm has been shattered. Should our device prove to be of use in the detection of life beyond our star, it could pave the way for a new age in which we all may live in peace.\nIt is for that reason that I have asked Forename to aid me in constructing a more advanced Aethernet. I have also asked him to assist me in procuring additional components for the Resistance's device.\nOnce I have assembled the necessary parts, I intend to send them to the Ala Mhigan Resistance.\nShould you be interested in learning more, pray speak with Kishiligh again.

Should the Black Wolf be allowed to stand, the very fate of this realm hangs in the balance.\nI cannot in good conscience place the fate of my nation, or that of my family, in the hands of a man who may or may not be true. I will not stand for it.\nYou have my thanks, Forename. I do not know what you will do with the sigil itself, but I hope you find value in it.

Dialogue: ['\nVarthon:', '\nGreetings, Forename. I am pleased to inform you that the Orphanage has been awarded a new patient.\nHe is a boy of fourteen and is being cared for by one of our most gifted ancillaets.\nYou will be familiar with the name Ancillaet de Haillenarte, one of Ishgard's foremost ancillasets. He is a master of his art and an invaluable provider of healing.\nA recent bout of scurvy has taken his vision off, but he is making steady progress. He was last seen leaving the Orphanage with a child in his arms.', '\nAncillaet:', "\nOh, hello there. Come to see Varthon, have you?\nI'm not sure what you're here for, but I'm sure you'll be pleased to know my son is doing well.", '\nVarthon:', '\nAncillaet de Haillenarte awaits your arrival.', '\nAncillaet:', "\nYou've come to see Varthon? I'm sure you were hoping to speak with him.", '\nVarthon:', "\nIt's good to see you again. The orphanage has been blessed by the heavens since our founding.\nAncillaet's gift to us was his boundless compassion. He would go above and beyond to help all who were unable to care for themselves.\nTo be able to give someone else the same amount of love he gave himself... I can tell you've done a lot of thinking about him.\nHe was a kind, strong-willed boy, but there is one thing he was not: stubborn. He would often get into trouble and get himself hurt.\nI'm sure you've thought of what he would want you to say to him if you could. Here it is.\nI want you to know that no matter what he did, he was always looking out for the welfare of others. He cared deeply for his fellow man.\nThat selfless act of heroism inspired him to take up the sword and give his life for the sake of others. It's for that reason we named him ancillaet.\nWhen he was born, we couldn't have dreamed he would become who he is today. We had no idea he would be cared for by an ancillaet like him. It would've been like him taking on a new role, but Varthon always saw him as he is now─as a son who loves the world and would one day take up the sword to fight for peace."]

Even should the magicked scrolls be destroyed following a battle with the Resistance, their memories would not be erased, you see.\nIf the memories are to be saved at all, they must be preserved at all costs. That is why they have petitioned Master Gerolt to develop a means of preserving their memories using another means of destruction.\nAnd I say “another means of destruction.” As you may have guessed, their request is not to be taken lightly.\nIf successful, this new method of destruction would not only be effective─it would be entirely safe.\nAye, the memories would be securely locked away, never to be used again.

Might you be interested in trying out a new recipe that I've come up with?\nIt's a simple one, really. All you need to do is find a flower that blooms near the House of Splendors, and sprinkle a little anethema on it.\nThe recipe is simple enough, but the results are anything but: the aether released by the aetherial spray you use when mixing the aetherial powder is poisonous to most lifeforms.

Dialogue: ['\nHaurchefant:', "Ah, Forename. I was hoping you'd come by. I've been thinking of how grateful I am to have you with me─and how much I wish we still had Lady Minfilia.\nI'm sure you've had your share of ups and downs in your life, but I think it important that you return to the company if you can.\nLady Minfilia was one of the finest tacticians the realm has ever seen, and her influence will be felt forevermore by the Scions.\nReturning to the Yellowjackets would be a dream come true for most, but I know it would be worth your while.\nLady Minfilia was born into a noble family. She was trained to be an alchemist, and her love of the fine arts led her to seek out the fabled city of Par Vath.\nAfter the Calamity robbed her of her fortune, Lady Minfilia made a choice: to leave the city and return home to Ul'dah, or face certain ruin.\nLady Minfilia chose the latter, and in the years that followed has tirelessly worked to rebuild what was laid to ruin.\nHer tireless efforts have made Ul'dah a better place, and I'm sure our comrades would be proud to have her as our comrade-in-arms.\nI've said my piece, but I would be most glad if you would speak with our man at the pier. I can think of no one more capable of conveying the Lady's sentiments.", '\nPierriquet:', "Aye, I'm Pierriquet. Lady Minfilia sent word we'd be having a little rest and recuperation.\nBut I don't mean to brag. I've been through a lot with the Coeurls, and they've taught me more about life than I'll ever know.\nThey say Lady Minfilia's the only one who's ever done more for the Scions than I have. I'll do everything I can to repay the debt of my kind.\nThe other day, I was jogging along the pier when I came across this young girl.\nI couldn't help but notice her striking figure, and the way she carried herself. She reminded me of my own mother, who died when I was yet a babe.\nThough our paths have diverged, I would do anything to repay the kindness of strangers like her.\nSo I stopped and asked her if she was looking for a friend. She said she was, and that she was in the right place.\nI couldn't help but feel a little sad, for Lady Minfilia has been gone so long. But she said she would find her, and that I should come along.\nI know nothing in the ways of romance, but I thought perhaps visiting her in her hometown would be enough to give me a taste of what she's been through.\nI promised I'd keep her safe, and I won't let anyone harm her.\nSo I decided to go and meet her. I'll be back in a bit, so come meet me on the pier when you're done.", '\nMinfilia:', "Welcome back. I trust your meeting with the young lady was enlightening?\nOh, thank goodness.\nI've heard the stories, but to see her in person... It was like a dream.\nIt's a pity she couldn't find her friend, but we mustn't let that stop us from fulfilling our duty to serve Lady Minfilia.\nUl'dah needs our strength, and I won't take my new life in Ul'dah for granted.\nI won't take my new life in Ul'dah for granted.\nI'll keep doing what I can to repay the kindness of strangers like her.\nThank you for your kindness today, Forename. It's meant more to me than you could know."]
