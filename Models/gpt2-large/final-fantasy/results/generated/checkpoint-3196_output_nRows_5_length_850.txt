However, he had no idea how dangerous the sylphs would become once the Light took their toll on him.\nHe cursed himself and his curse, and sought to make the world see the error of his ways. But all his efforts were for naught. The Light took his curse and used it to destroy the sylphs.\nYears later, when the sylphs came back to take their toll on the other races, the elder cursed those who had used their powers for evil.\nBut it was too late. By then, the Light had already used up its last ingredient─gulls.\nIt is a terrible shame, but we must learn to harness the power of the Light once more if we are to save Gridania.\nI thank you once again for coming along on my search.

Title: A Blissful Arrival
Dialogue: ['\nYsayle:', '\nAh, Forename. I was hoping you would come.\nI trust you are enjoying your time with the Blessed.\nI am certain many here have similar experiences─though I suspect mine differ from yours in that they are not exclusively positive.\nYes, many of us have found inspiration in the teachings of the Blessed, but what we desire most is to live a truly happy life. To achieve this, however, we must experience joy in our work and in our relationships.\nThus, I would ask you to meditate on one of the most profound teachings taught in the Blessed─the Dhamma.\nIn the Dhamma, we are taught that all emotions─not only joyous emotions such as pleasure and happiness─are created in the mind. This leads me to believe that, for some, the joy of living may be accompanied by unpleasant emotions such as grief and despair.\nVery well. Pray begin by paying a visit to the Dhamma, and paying close attention to the emotions that arise. Try to pay them no mind. When they have been sufficiently aroused, return to me.\nHere, I will give you some advice. When you are ready, meditate on the Dhamma one last time. When you are finished, return to me.', '\nYsayle:', '\nHow does the Dhamma feel to you?', '\nYsayle:', '\nIt has been a long time coming, Forename.\nAs a layperson, I understand it is difficult to truly understand what it means to be at peace with one's mind. But as a student of the Dhamma─as I am─I believe I have come to understand it better than anyone.\nWhen we meditate on the Dhamma, we are practicing a very important mental practice─the practice of seeing. By paying close attention to the emotions that arise, we can begin to see the truth of our own thoughts and feelings.\nBy paying close attention to the emotions that arise, we can begin to see the truth of our own thoughts and feelings. And this, I believe, is the true state of mind─the joy we seek.\nMay we strive to attain this joy, and may our happy life be full and rich.\n']

I fear we may have lost the war, but at least we have won the battle.\nNow, to think of what we have done...\nA great hero, vanquished in battle, lies in a quiet, yet comfortable, resting place. You will surely be curious to know what has become of him.\nVery well. We shall reveal to you, in a moment, that which has kept him hidden for so long.\nIn the aftermath of the battle with the sin eaters, he spent a number of years in seclusion, away from prying eyes.\nHe refused all food and drink, and spent his days lying in quiet, but still warm, beds.\nHe died, in his sleep, of a heart attack. His body was discovered by his son, who had found him collapsed in a corner.\nThe boy was inconsolable, and began shouting for his father. Eventually, he came to his senses, and came running to us.\nWhen we saw what had become of him, we felt sick to our stomach. We could not bear the idea of losing our father, so we took him to the Great Work, where he is currently resting.\nWhile we are tending to his needs, I have continued my research into the battle.\nThere, I have found a most fascinating theory. Namely, that of the “incident.”\nSimply put, it is the battle which gave rise to the sin eaters. They were borne on the wings of a giant bird, which was slain by a man.\nIncident─or the battle which gave rise to it─was a catalyst for the growth of the sin eaters.\nIf confirmed, this would explain why they emerged from the carcass, and why they took up residence within the Greatwood.\nTheories abound, but one stands out as the most intriguing. Namely, that of the “incident.”\nThe Great Work may have been instigated by a sin eater, and the War effort which followed, in order to purge the forest of the beasts.\nSuch a benevolent endeavor would surely have earned the respect and gratitude of the Greatwood's inhabitants, had it taken place.\nThe War effort, however, was waged to save the Greatwood from destruction, and the sin eaters were seen as a threat.\nThe matter was ultimately settled by the triumvirate, and the sin eaters were banished from the Greatwood.\nIt is said that the leaders of the three powers─the Father, the Son, and the Holy See─agreed upon this course of action.\nIt is an interesting theory, but one which I am reluctant to make public. My curiosity is not so easily sated, after all.\nSo long as you remain here, I shall keep you apprised of developments. Godsspeed, Forename.', '\nPop:', '\nYou sense a hostile presence!']

Dialogue: ['\nSeverian:', "\nSo, the scouts report that the Sahagin were sighted west of the mouth of the Snake. Given what we know of their strength, and the difficulty in assessing their movements, it would seem prudent to assume that they are near the Sahagin homeland.\nMy plan is to send these frigates west, where they will be more easily attacked by the Sahagin. While they are within their assigned sector, I will attempt to draw them out─to the point where they're forced to reveal themselves.\nOnce the battle begins, I need you to use this device to cloak yourselves in the most effective manner. While it's not absolutely necessary, you may as well make use of it in case the enemy draws their weapons.\nI would appreciate it if you could use this device to cloak yourselves in the most effective manner. While it's not absolutely necessary, you may as well make use of it in case the enemy draws their weapons.", '\nPop:', '\nThe air begins to crackle with aetherial energies!', '\nSeverian:', "\nAh, you're back. So, the scouts have concluded that the Sahagin are near the Sahagin homeland?\nI see. I suppose that's in the cards, then.\nI shall have to reconsider our plan of attack.\nBefore I do so, however, there is one more thing I would like to do.\nA chance to reflect on our victory, and what it means for the future.\nBefore I return to the Congregation, there is one last thing I would like to do.\nTake these treasures I gave you, and take them back to Father. I would like to thank him for giving us the courage to face the enemy."]
