Oh, thank goodness.\nI was beginning to wonder if this was all just a big elaborate joke.\nAs you've undoubtedly noticed, we Azure Dragoon are not so different from the gods among the other races. We are gods among men, in fact, with a special regard for what manner of tools we use to make our living.\nAnd tools are important to us, it turns out. Tools are our livelihood, and tools are an important part of our culture. It's something I wanted to preserve, after all.\nSo when I saw that hammer lying abandoned on the ground, I knew right away that this was a grave mistake. I couldn't just leave it here─I had to get it back.\nBut how? How do you get a hammer back to its former owner? I know not how─I haven't the slightest idea.\nBut as an amateur craftsman, you're not like to go asking someone for help. Might you do it in my stead?\nYou see, a hammer is one of the most important tools we use. In fact, I think it's one of the most important tools we've ever used.\nYou see, it's one of our guild's main sources of livelihood. The craftsmen who make the tools we use must be able to use them to their best potential if they're to carry out their jobs.\nIf they break, they're no longer able to do their jobs. A hammer must be made strong, sturdy, and able to take a beating before it can do its job.\nUnfortunately, tools like this one are in short supply. There are just too many to keep up with. But as an amateur, you've no one to blame but yourself if you break something important.\nSo I'd be grateful if you could find a way to get a hammer back to its rightful owner.\nI'll go and search for one of these in my stead. Please hurry─I'm not in any hurry to get this hammer back to me."]

Dialogue: ['\nLaniaitte:', 'Ah, Forename. It is good to see you both hale and whole.\nYou have both proven yourselves to be stout and valiant fighters, and this shows in our mutual victories.\nTo be recognized as comrades, however, we must be able to agree on a common enemy.

Well, I'll tell you: we're not here to discuss the finer points of battle.\nWhat we're here for is information. That's what you came for, yes? Then let's get right to it.\nWe've received word that some brave souls have ventured into the Sapsa Spawning Grounds in search of the legendary beastman axe.\nThese warriors are adamant that they have seen the axe in the hands of Sahagin. They say they were attacked by Sahagin in their search, and that they slew the creatures with their own hands.\nBut tell me: why would a Sahagin choose to fight you?\nWell, I understand that you're a veteran of many a grueling battle. But I've heard it said that the axe is a treasured possession of the elite of the Sapsa royal family.\nSo why would a Sahagin choose to fight a fellow member of their royal family?\nWell, I can only assume that the axe is something that the Sahagin hold dear. And seeing as how they're already under our protection, I don't think that it's a matter of great consequence.\nBut, as you say, the Sapsa royal family is very much involved in this. I think it only fair that they bear the burden of proving our claims.\nSo, as a fellow Sapsa royal, I'm sure you can understand why we would be reluctant to allow any of our members to be killed in a battle they did not personally choose.\nBut I digress.

I trust you're up to the task?\nWonderful. I wish I had more staff to help me with this, but these are serious matters we need to be addressing. I would be ever so grateful if you could take on a few of the more pressing issues at the moment.\nApes abound in the ruins, and I would be ever so grateful if you could dispatch of them. For example, was it not plague that which was causing the researchers a deal of distress?\nPlease hurry.

Dialogue: ['\nKomuxio:', '\nWe are truly blessed to have such a compassionate soul as you here. It is truly a blessing.\nYou see, in the midst of all of the chaos, I found myself lost. And I, for one, am not making a good first impression!\nBut I know this: if I can't change people's hearts, then I at least need to try! And you are here to help! So please, take this!\nIt is a small token of my gratitude, but I hope you will use it in your efforts. Show my thanks to everyone. And tell them that I am looking forward to hearing their praises!', '\nAlphinaud:', '\n...Oh, thank goodness. I am not sure I would have been able to carry on a single conversation had you not stepped in.\nI will spare no effort to make amends, and I promise to do everything in my power to earn your favor.\nTo start with, perhaps you could speak with the people here again? I would be glad to hear their praise for you.\nI know that it will be a while yet before I can repay your kindness, but know that I am grateful─even if I am only able to express it in token form.', '\nHaurchefant:', '\nWhat an unusual odor you have there. Perhaps I should go and freshen up...', '\nFrettingway:', '\nOh dear... I do hope I am not imagining it. There is so much here that I do not know how to make a start.', '\nNibald:', '\nWhat a relief to see you again! It is good to see you again. I was worried that my absence might cause you distress.\nThough I am still a little ways off, I am sure that I can at least make a start with these notes. Please do let me know if you would like to continue.', '\nLydha Lran:', '\nYou are returned! And not in one piece, I see. Were you able to find anyone in particular to express their appreciation?\nThe Elder Seedseer was most effusive in her praise. I am sure that she would be happy to hear that you helped bring about a respite from the chaos.\nShe spoke of your triumph in taking the initiative to seek out the sylph elder. She praised your bravery in standing up to the beast, not only figuratively, but in the flesh.\nShe also spoke of your noble deed of retrieving the sylph elder's crystal. She bade me bestow it upon you on her behalf.\nI have no doubt that she will wish to thank you in person, and so I shall inform her that it is now in her hands.\nPlease accept this as a token of my gratitude. It is not much, but please accept it nonetheless. I would be forever in your debt.', '\nKomuxio:', '\nPlease tell everyone that I am looking forward to hearing their praises!', '\nAlphinaud:', '\n...Oh, thank goodness.

The road back is long and arduous, but I would see you on your feet again, and on your feet alone.\nTravel far and wide, across the realm, and beyond─you will find no limits to the riches of the wood. The great wyrm Hraesvelgr awaits your coming.\nWhen last we met, you were yet a fledgling hero in your own right. Today, you will take the stage once more, and in so doing, will honor the memory of our great hero.\nThere is a tale told of a hero who was said to wield a sword so bright it could cut through the dark. That hero was said to be so great was it simply to wield such a blade.\nWell, I ask you, have you ever thought to see for yourself what it might be like to wield a sword so bright? I would like you to go to Candlekeep Quay in central Thanalan and examine the sword for yourself.\nMake haste, for the sword is not to be found there. Go straight to Candlekeep Quay and examine the sword for yourself.", '\nPop:', '\nThe air begins to crackle with aetherial energies!', '\nWanderingminstrel:', '\nWhat wonders will you see, what sounds will you hear, if you go to Candlekeep Quay and examine the sword for yourself?', '\nWanderingminstrel:', "\nI can tell you what you will not see, what you will not hear. The blade of this greatsword is the very embodiment of Light, and wielder must not look to its blade for strength.\nIt is said that a knight in the service of a Dark Lord once wielded this very sword, that he might best a rival in battle.\nTo this day, it remains in the keeping of the Wailers in Gridania. It was passed down through generations, and in recent years, a number of younglings have been tasked with its restoration.\nBut this is but one story. There are others, more troubling, that must be told. Tell me, Forename, what did you see?\nWhat wonders will you see, what sounds will you hear, if you go to Candlekeep Quay and examine the sword for yourself?", '\nWanderingminstrel:', '\nTell me, Forename─what did you see?', '\nWanderingminstrel:', "\nI see... That is to say, the sword is a masterpiece, is it not? A work of art beyond compare.\nIts surface is marred only by a few nicks and scratches, yet beneath that there is a wealth of detail, from the weight of the hilt to the weight of the pommel.\nHesitance! That is what we call a quality that surpasses the best crafted wares.\nIt is a quality that should be prized by any sword-wielder, not least among our own people.\nBut I digress. You have my thanks for taking the time to listen to my tale. Here is a reward for your efforts."]
