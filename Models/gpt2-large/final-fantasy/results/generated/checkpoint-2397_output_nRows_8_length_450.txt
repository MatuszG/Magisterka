I've been looking for someone to take part in a deal I'm trying to set up.\nThe hunters I'm trying to attract are quite rare─I've yet to track one down─and hunting them is a tall order.\nBut one hunter has agreed to join me, and I'm ready to offer him a hefty bounty for his efforts.\nHe should be at the Sapphire Avenue Exchange in Limsa Lominsa. Come find him and give him the details, would you?", '\nMogmont:', "I was hoping you might join me in hunting these elusive hunters.\nHe should be at the Sapphire Avenue Exchange in Limsa Lominsa. Come find him and give him the details, would you?", '\nMogmont:', "You're back! And with good news, I hope.\nThe hunter you were after was captured by a band of goblins─giant slugs, I think they called them.\nYou see, a deal hunter like Mogmont needs to attract a sufficient number of goblins before he can set up his hunt.\nAnd since the beasts aren't wont to attack without provocation, it's essential that the hunter attracts enough goblins to force the goblins to attack him.\nThis is the first time I've ever needed the help of a deal hunter, and I'm grateful for your help.\nMy thanks to you, hunter. I hope you'll do more hunting in the future."]

Dialogue: ['\nWanderingminstrel:', "\nA band of pirates has struck a deal with the Maelstrom, and together they will capture a fearsome new beast─the dread treant.\nThe beast's appearance is that of a tall, skinny man with bushy white hair. His name, “Eschiva,” is said to be the patron deity of sailors.\nThe pirates themselves are of course not the only ones who worship the great wyrm. Legend tells that he can summon the strength of ten men, and that he rules over the waters with an iron hand.\nEschiva, however, rules over only the waters. The true nature of the beast is shrouded in mystery, and even the pirates themselves know not what to make of him.\nBut one thing is clear: if the pirates are to be believed, he will be an extremely valuable trophy─and one that the Maelstrom will be willing to pay a high price for.\nMy best guess is that he will be captured during the course of the next few days. I will keep you posted on this as we continue to pursue our quarry.\nYou should return to the Waking Sands and tell the others that the treant has been found. I will follow you, so that you may return to the Waking Sands at your earliest convenience.", '\nPop:', '\nYou sense a hostile presence!']
