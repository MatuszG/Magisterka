If you're willing to lend a hand, you'd be doing us a great service, wouldn't you agree?\nI'll start by speaking with the stallholders a bit closer to the stage. That way, if anyone comes calling, I can point them in the right direction.\nOnce that's done, I need you to go and make sure the soldiers in the barracks are safe. There's a lot of danger around here, and I need everyone on alert."]
