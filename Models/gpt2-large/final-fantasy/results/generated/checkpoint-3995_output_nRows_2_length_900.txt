Dialogue: ['\nAlisaie:', "\nWelcome back, Forename! It's good to see you, as well as our stalwart ally, the stalwart ally of Ronka!\nAs it happens, word has reached us that the imperials have struck a deal with one of Ronka's rivals!\nThe Stone Torches, as the outfit is known, are in the midst of a struggle with the Ixal for control of the territory to the east.\nUnder normal circumstances, we would not dignify the offer with an answer, but the Torches have been in a state of disrepair for some time now, and a deal of goodwill is not to be had with an imperial enemy.\nIf you are interested in joining the Stone Torches in the battle against the Ixal, speak with Commander Rhiki at the barracks. She will be glad to hear of your interest!\nAnd if you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask Commander Rhiki!", '\nRhiki:', "\nAh, the esteemed commander. I'm Rhiki, and who might you be...?\nForename, Alisaie, I understand you wish to join the Stone Torches. Indeed, there is an opening for a capable soldier.\nI would be honored to add to the ranks of your esteemed companions. I only ask that you first furnish us with your mind and heart.\nIf you've come seeking a battle to match your bravado, the answer is no. We are not wont to enter into engagements without a clear strategy in place.\nThe Ixal are a formidable foe─the likes of which the Stone Torches have never faced. Yet if we cannot assume that all are equal, then we must not assume victory. We must win at all costs.\nTo that end, I offer you the chance to test your mettle against the Ixal in a exclusive contest.\nParticipating soldiers will be awarded exclusive equipment, which you are free to take as you see fit.\nOnce the contest is complete, the soldier with the highest score will be declared the winner!\nJudging by your expression, I take it you are eager to part with your new comrades-in-arms. Good luck to you, my friend!\n"]

You've the look of a man who travels.\nSo I went to my local bookstores and picked up a volume entitled, “A Bargain Struck.” Well, that's all I can say.

The one who got in my head, that one! I was just thinking about a friend of mine, a merchant from Gridania who's visiting from outside the Crystarium. He's a regular of mine─a regular whose name you'll not find in the volumes, unfortunately.\nI'm sure he'd appreciate it if you could deliver the goods to him in Revenant's Toll. It'd be a shame to let him down.", '\nEnpc:', "Greetings, sir. Is there something I can help you with?\nA book from the Crystarium, you say?...Hm, well, I'd be lying if I said more books weren't sent my way today.\nAye, a bargain, indeed! It contains the details of an agreement between the Syndicate and the landlords of Revenant's Toll.\nIt seems the wealthy nobles of the old days could afford to purchase not only land, but magic items as well.\nThe books are a regular of mine─one I'm certain my friend would enjoy. But why would he want to lend them to a stranger?\nWell, that's all well and good, but why would anyone be willing to part with a book like that?\nWho knows... Perhaps the owner of the book is a member of the Syndicate himself? If so, I suppose there is a way to redeem it...\nIn any case, I thank you for the book. Here, you have it. Please give it to my friend in Revenant's Toll.", '\nEustacia:', "Ah, you've returned! And not a book, but a gift! And not a worthless book, either! You have my thanks for procuring this for me.\nIt's a small gesture, but I'm sure my friend will appreciate it.\nAs I was saying, this was a bargain. Even a meager book could buy a great deal of wealth in those days.\nAnd I'm sure my friend will treasure the contents of this book. It wouldn't be fair to give it away just yet, after all.\nDo you know what it's like to work in an underground economy? It's a harsh, unforgiving world. Hardly anything is free in those parts, but a few gil here and there can go a long way.\nYou, on the other hand, have everything you need to live a comfortable life. I'm sure that's worth saving for later!"]

Title: A Beeautiful Plan
Dialogue: ['\nCeh-ceeth:', "\nOho! You've come at the very moment I'm about to make my greatest discovery yet!\nThere's a problem with my experimental prototype, you see. The bees I want to pollute have taken a liking to my metal–made contraption.\nTheir short-sightedness knows no bounds. I've designed a new contraption to pollute their nests, but I need you to destroy three of their flying specimens.\nThat's a lot of bees, so I can't rely on you to destroy one by yourself. If you can manage to destroy three of the buggers, that should be enough!", '\nCeh-ceeth:', "\nYou blasted the bees? Goodness, you're a natural at this! I knew I could count on you.\nThe problem lies with the metal I used to make the contraption. It's strong, but its strength is spread thin. Bees don't seem to mind the metal's spongy feel.\nI've tried coating the inside with a thin coating of this alloy, but that doesn't seem to have worked.\nIf I'm to make my discovery stick, I'll have to mix the metal with something else... Hmm, maybe this coating of mine is too thick?\nI'm sure the bees will find a way to get at the metal. For now, I'll leave the coating to you. I'll pollute their nests before you get your hands on it!"]

If we put this idea to the guild, they'll be swarmed with orders from all directions! Oh, but wait... What if the bees get wind of this and start leaving orders for us!?

Go through their ranks and make sure they don't have anything to worry about.", '\nLauriane:', "\nAs the name suggests, we are a guild specializing in the collection of rare plants. We do our best to fulfill all requests─though sometimes there are simply too many to handle.\nI suppose you'd be familiar with the concept, kupo.
