I trust you will not be disappointed.\nThe gift is a token of the hope that the Scions will one day establish a new nation in the north.\nWe are a people who value trade, and it is for this reason that we have established a trading post at Camp Tranquil. It is here that we make our living, and it is our hope that the gifts you have brought will contribute to the continued prosperity of Camp Tranquil.\nYou are welcome here. If you wish to speak further, I will not deny you.\n...And yet, I would ask you to do more than merely express our gratitude─you must help us fulfill our duty as a trading nation.\nIn cooperation with the Adventurers' Guild, we have established a new system through which our citizens may be asked to perform certain services for the purpose of earning a living.\nThese tasks range from feeding the beasts that roam the plains─a simple task that would serve anyone─to building barricades to fortifications that can be deployed against the Horde.\nIn return, we have promised them protection should any of the tasks they have been asked to undertake come to a violent end.\nIt is, in short, a system in which we wish to entrust the protection of our citizens with those who are most capable of fulfilling its provisions.\nBut you are one of those who are most capable, and you have a responsibility to assist us as much as possible. It would be in your best interests to learn more about this new system and make yourself ready to fulfill its requirements should we call upon you to do so.\nNow then, it is high time that you learned how to wield this new weapon.\nWhen you have learned the basics, I would ask that you take it up and give it a try.\nI look forward to seeing how you can use it to its fullest potential!"]

Dialogue: ['\nDmitar:', "I hear you've been busy, yes? If you have a moment, I could also use some help revising the current plan.\nWe have a new approach to hive creation, and while it's worked well so far, it's clear that more work needs to be done before we can achieve our ultimate objective.\nInstead of simply spawning more bees, we want to produce more honeybees, but we know little about how they behave in the wild.\nTo get a better idea of how they might behave in the wild, we decided to construct a new model of hive, one based on the behavior of honeybees in nature. We named it the Beekeeper's Palace, and it was created to provide a more naturalistic experience for new bees─one that's free of the distractions and stresses common to most hives.\nTo help guide the new bees, we created a new species of flower─a yellow pansy─that's native to the island of Vylbrand. To encourage the bees to build nests in its vicinity, we provided it with a special secretion that attracts wild bees.\nThe Palace is now home to at least three different types of bees─one for each of the three habitats it contains, and one for each of the three habitats it contains only.\nWhile this is by no means an exact science, it should provide an excellent framework for guiding new bees.\nI should also mention that we are working with a different model of hive. As you might expect, the Apis are struggling to adapt, and we're having a difficult time creating a suitable habitat for them.\nAs such, we've been forced to revert to our original method of spawning bees. While it's become increasingly difficult to find suitable habitats for the Apis, the native bees have provided us with an ideal solution to our dilemma.\nThe native bees are especially adept at constructing nests in hollows and caves, and we were hoping to test their nest-building skills against the Palace's hollows and caves, but it seems the bees have already taken the nest itself.\nI'll need you to check if the bees have taken the nest yet, but if they've already taken it, I'll need you to take it back to them and explain the situation.\nI can't thank you enough for helping me get this far. Hopefully now you'll have some useful experience under your belts.\nIf you want to try your hand at beekeeping, you might consider joining us.", '\nDmitar:', 'I would like to thank you once again for your help.

Well...we're looking for a kind of wood that's both durable and beautiful. A wood that can perform a wide variety of tasks.\nAnd in that regard, we can't just ask for “any” kind of wood─we must specifically ask for the kind of wood we're after.\nWhich, in this case, means we're after a species of maple─a species that grows to the west of here, on the island of Vira Nilya.\nNow, the island of Vira Nilya is home to a number of different kinds of trees, each of which has its own special qualities.\nBut none of them are better suited for crafting our desired object than the maple.\nOnce we've decided which species of maple we want, we send word to the local mill─a sort of intermediary between our client and the craftsman─and ask for them to gather the necessary materials.\nOnce those materials arrive, we proceed to the workshop, where the master crafts our gift.\nNow, what do you think? Is it something you'd be interested in receiving?\nWe'd be most grateful for any information you can provide. And if you have any questions, I'm always here to answer them.\nOh, and before I forget, here's your payment. It should be ample compensation for your time, effort, and treasure.\nNow, let's get right to it!\nSo, what do you think? Is it something you'd be interested in receiving?\nWe'd be most grateful for any information you can provide. And if you have any questions, I'm always here to answer them."]

Fearing his life may be in danger, he flees into a forest where he finds a sacred axe, which he uses to cut down a number of the enemy.\nWhile the Azure Dragoon fights, he is transported back to the scene of his victory, where he finds a small altar where a golden lily blooms. From this he is able to meditate upon the memories of his battle, and thereby find the strength to carry on.\nI believe the lily is a manifestation of the Azure Dragoon's inner strength─his spirit shining as it did in battle.\nThe song is sure to excite the audience, and I'm sure you'll feel the same.

However, what makes this gift special is the manner in which it was crafted.\nFor one thing, it was crafted by a woman. For another, it was crafted with the utmost care, and with the aid of an opo.\nI hope that you will find enjoyment in playing the flute, and that you will not only learn something from my friend, but that you will be inspired to play your own flute in the future.']
