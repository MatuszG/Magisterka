You see, the time has come for the Mogwin's newest creations to be put to the test─and I mean that literally.\nWe've prepared these beasts in the image of the four great tribes of ancient times. They're meant to wreak havoc upon the land, but they need a master to direct them.\nThat's where you come in! The Mogwin's newest creations aren't meant to be unleashed on the land by themselves, but they require guidance to do their utmost.
