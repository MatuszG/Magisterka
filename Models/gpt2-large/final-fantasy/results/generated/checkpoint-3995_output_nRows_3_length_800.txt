Dialogue: ['\nAlphinaud:', '...Hm? Did I hear you rightly?\nYou wish to forge an item of divine worth, are you not?\nBy what authority can you claim this divine instrument? I meant no disrespect, of course...but the mere fact that you wish to does not make it any less important.\nA fine instrument, indeed, but one with a humble history. The first known use of the phrase “holy instrument” is said to be the first mention of aught other than gold in the New Testament.\nIn the old days, the Pharos Sirius was the center of our temple. There was a bench there reserved for the use of goldsmiths. I do not believe it was ever used for anything other than ceremonial purposes.\nWhen the Church moved to the Quicksand, however, they removed the bench and devoted the site to a more suitable location. That is where you will find the relic you seek.\nI will not waste your time. You need only make your way to the Sapphire Avenue Exchange, where you will find the relic.', '\nKarnes:', 'You... You came from the same place as the first goldsmith?\nI had been pondering my next step.\nI would like to craft a new piece of equipment, but I know next to nothing about metal.\nI do, however, have a master's research note that may be of assistance to you.\nPlease take this to the man at the desk in front of the altar.\nPlease do return to me once your work is complete.', '\nYugiri:', 'You have brought the relic I asked for?\nHow very good of you to come.\nI will examine the instrument closely. Do be careful not to damage it.\nAs you wish, there is a parchment containing the details of the transaction. Please be assured that it is your responsibility to keep the parchment safe.\nWhen you are finished, deliver it to Mistress Rowena.\nAnd be careful. This is a holy instrument, and should not be played without the proper accoutrements.\nI trust you now have everything you need to make the divine instrument you seek.\nPlease make the necessary preparations and deliver the instrument to its rightful owner.\nI will see that the metal you have brought is used to craft another sacred relic.\nReturn here when your work is complete. Good luck in your endeavors.', '\nAlphinaud:', 'Ah, there you are.\nBy your triumphant expression, I take it the relic you have crafted is now ready to be worn.\nI trust you now have learned a valuable lesson from this experience.\nNot all are quick to trust outsiders with sacred objects. There are those who see only profit in keeping things to themselves─or in using them to further their own ends.\nFor a soul to truly understand the value of something, they must first experience it for themselves.\nI pray you will one day be able to make use of your divine instrument.\nIf you desire anything else I might offer you, please let me know.']

Dialogue: ['\nPaulemont:', "Ah, to have so many hands working for so great a cause... It must be difficult to find one who shares your passion for music.\nI'm searching for a gifted young instrumentalist, willing to join me in the performance of our sacred art.\nHe must possess the sensitivity and sensitivity alone to hear the score of a piece even as it is being composed. Oh, how I wish I had a son like you in mind.\nYou will find the young instrumentalist at the Octant, by the entrance to the Sanctum. I have no doubt he will be there.", '\nYoung instrumentalist:', "Hark! I sense a hostile presence!\nWhat!? Another attack!? I would sooner die than become a mere instrument!

I am honored to have been given the opportunity to play this piece.\nI-I confess I am not entirely convinced by his claims. He has yet to offer any convincing evidence. Nevertheless, I will gladly submit to the sacrifice if he will provide me with another instrument to play upon the morrow.\nOh? You wish to know the details? Then I will leave you to it.\nI will submit to the sacrifice of another Dravanian instrument. But you must promise me that, no matter how it turns out, you will not be held accountable for my actions.\nI would be most honored if you would agree to play the piece for me on the morrow. Please make good use of your new found freedom, and let me know when you are ready to undertake the sacrifice.", '\nYoung instrumentalist:', 'I-I did not realize until after the fact...
