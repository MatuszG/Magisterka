Dialogue: ['\nBodwine:', '\nAh, Forename. I trust you are enjoying your atma–infused relic?\nNow, while it does indeed grant you enhanced strength, it does not grant you invulnerability. As such, it is essential that you maintain a healthy regimen of atma–infused training.\nFor the uninitiated, atma is essentially the crystallized soul of a living being. Though it can be infused with other substances, its primary purpose is to enhance your physical strength.\nNow, as you may have noticed, our weapons and armor are of a higher quality than those of most other races. This is due to the use of quality materials, such as atma.\nHowever, quality alone will not ensure victory─the refinement process also requires the use of atma-infused training.\nAnd as your training proceeds, you will come to learn how best to apply the atma infusion to your weapon.\nFor the uninitiated, the process of atma infusion can be somewhat daunting. Do not worry─it is a simple enough affair. All you need do is find a suitable location to train, and begin by drawing a picture of your desired effect on the atma crystal.\nOnce you have achieved a high level of atma–infused mastery, come to me for further guidance. Here, I will draw the picture for you.\nGo forth and draw the picture of your desired effect on the atma crystal. Practice drawing it until it becomes second nature.\nLikewise, when you have attained a high level of atma–infused mastery,

I'm told they've spotted a lone specimen so far.\nIt's entirely possible that the beast you sighted was merely a fledgling colt, or a littering pup. But if they are indeed responsible for the burgeoning population, they should be expecting a fight.\nI daresay a colt fresh out of training is more inclined to bite the hand that feeds it. And as we have already seen, colts are not the easiest creatures to train. I shudder to think what could have become of Master Cid if he'd been slain by a pup...\nIt's not my place to be dealing with such matters, but if you have an interest in helping, I ask that you seek out Gontrant in West Hawkers' Alley. He will be glad to hear of any colts hatching from the nest.\nI cannot vouch for the identity of the colt responsible for Master Cid's demise, but it's safe to assume it was a yellow colt. Judging by how quickly the beast has grown, it must have been born in the Twelveswood.\nThe Brass Blades have sent word that they've discovered a new species of colt in the woodlands─one unlike any they have seen. I pray that this one is as belligerent as the Brass Blades have described him.\nI pray that the Yellowjackets are able to best this colt, or else this tale will be forever untold..."]
