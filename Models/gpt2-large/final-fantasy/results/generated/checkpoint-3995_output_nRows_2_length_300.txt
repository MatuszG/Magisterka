Oh, I should probably tell you what's going on.\nAs you've undoubtedly noticed, the area around the apiary is rather drab. It's not that there's anything wrong with the place─far from it─but as a beekeeper, it's hard to make the necessary changes for the better.\nUsually, I would make my bees work longer and harder, but I've been given permission to leave the hive for an extended period.\nThis way, I can tend to more pressing matters such as choosing a new queen and getting her ready for

If they refuse to speak with you, leave them be and call out again.\nThe first was seen to be heading north towards the hive, while the second was seen to be heading east. The third is...alive. I've tried to wake it, but it refuses to respond.\nYou may want to question the third suspect. It may be able to provide valuable information.", '\nVarthon:', "You've spoken with the suspect? Excellent. Let us move on to the next suspect.", '\nErichthon:', "Hm? Yes, I'm Erichthon.\nAye, I'm the one who was spying on you. Varthon had sent word not long ago that he had found the missing ophion.\nIt's only a matter of time before the whole of Norvrandt is overrun with the creatures, and without the hive to keep them

Perhaps I was expecting a more welcoming environment?\nI see, I see... Well, the truth is, I had been worried that the workers would be unable to handle the quantity of fluid I requested.\nIt is no fault of yours that the delivery was delayed. I had intended to meet with the supervisor who was to collect the fluid, but he was nowhere to be found.\nThat said, I am grateful for your service─and should be the one to handle any further inquiries. My name is Taina, and I serve as the acting head of the research and development division at Meryall Agronomics."]
