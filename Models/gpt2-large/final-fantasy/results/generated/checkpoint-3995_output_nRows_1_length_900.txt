Hire a porter and have him carry the plots back to me.", '\nBaderon:', "Ah, you've returned! Now, tell me all about it.\n...Well, it's clear that you were not part of the attack. That bandits used stolen Royal Plantations plots to loot the surrounding area is beyond dispute.\nBut why would the Garleans, who conquered the area and named the region their own, turn on their allies?\nThis is a matter of great concern to us all. Let us work together to find the answer, Forename.\nI trust the porter who brought you here has already informed you of the situation? Good.\nI shall continue to search for the culprit and will be sure to keep you apprised of any developments.\nMeanwhile, I would ask that you return to the Crystarium and tell Sister Eluned what has transpired.\nI would also ask that you inform her of the good news, as well.\nI should like very much to hear your side of the story. Please hurry─the bandits are expected any moment now!", '\nEluned:', 'Greetings, Forename. Have you come for a moment?\n...Hm? You are not one of us, then?\nAh, the porter who brought you here has told me of the situation. He is right─these plots are not to be considered private property.\nPrivate property, as you well know, is a common enough concept in Eorzea. And it is these kinds of plots that the Garleans took from us.\nBut I must confess that I had begun to wonder if the Royal Plantations might not be the way to go about things.\nYou see, after the Calamity─and, by extension, the occupation─these lands have been returned to the people of Ala Mhigo.\nAnd while there were plenty of imperial sympathizers among the Resistance, a considerable number of our people sided with the Garleans.\nA surprising number of my countrymen joined the Resistance, you see, and while I was happy to see them come to an end, it opened my eyes to the possibility that there might be other ways to resolve our differences.\nAfter all, there is no force greater than the people themselves when pitted against an imperial force.\nSo I began to think... Perhaps the Royal Plantations might be a way to bring people together instead of bickering over who cheated whom.\nThis is a far cry from the days when I was branded a heretic for helping my countrymen. But I will take what help I can get, even if it means going my own way.\nThank you for your assistance, Forename. I will not take my new found freedom for granted."]
