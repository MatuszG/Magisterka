Dialogue: ['\nUrianger:', "\nAhem. Forename, I believe you've heard of the bargain we struck with the Vundu. They promised to help us rebuild our village, but they promised even more if we paid them for it.\nNow, we're not like to ask for anything in exchange for those promises. But, you see, there are certain items we need to rebuild our village. And the Vundu are willing to pay good coin for them.\nYou might think that a lot of coin is involved, but I assure you it's not─we're not like to give up so easily.\nTake these two vials of karakul blood. The blood is strong and thick, and when mixed with the soil and water from the river, it forms a powder that's ideal for mixing with soil.\nNow, mix the powder with the soil from the river. That's it! Now, it's as simple as mixing water and soil!\nYou can see the effect right away. It's as if you poured the whole village into a cauldron, then added a little air. And that's the magic of it.\nAs you can see, it's quite effective. With a little work, you could rebuild our village just like it was before.\nNow, go and see if it works for you. And if it doesn't, let me know.", '\nUrianger:', "\nWelcome back, Forename! I hope everything went well with the powder.\nThe soil from the river is ideal for mixing with the karakul blood.

It would've been a waste of time and resources to rebuild without them.", '\nUrianger:', "\nWe had a little trouble getting the villagers to agree to help us rebuild our village. But thanks to you, we now have a plan.\nThe villagers will help us rebuild our village by contributing to the rebuilding fund. We'll pay them for their work by giving them a share of our profits.\nThe villagers are already contributing to the fund, and we'll be using the funds to pay them for their work.\nWe've set up a trading post with the Vundu, and you can use it to buy any wares you like.\nWe'd like for them to help us rebuild our village, so we'll be asking them to pay for their work.\nWe've set up a trading post with the Vundu, and you can use it to buy any wares you like.\nWe'd like for them to help us rebuild our village, so we'll be asking them to pay for their work.\nThere are still some things we need to discuss before we can pay the villagers, but I hope you'll wait for us!"]

There has been no trading, and the merchants have been less willing to deal with each other.\nIt was always my intention to continue trading in the Dravanian Horde, but the Garleans have made it difficult. We are all too happy to do business with the Empire now.\nI imagine the Garleans are pleased as well. You have done us a great service today, adventurer."]

A problem that's bigger than any of us can imagine.\nI'm afraid we've been drawn into a conflict between the Empire and a band of outlaws known as the Scions.
