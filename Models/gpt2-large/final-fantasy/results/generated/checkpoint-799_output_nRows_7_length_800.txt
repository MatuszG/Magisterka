And so on.\nA melody can be played with any note, but we're going to focus on how you can change the notes you use to play.\nAfter all, the difference between a good song and a good melody is a matter of how you change the notes you use to play.\nThere are a few things that you need to know before you begin: how long you need to wait between notes, what kind of notes you use, and so on.\nYou should also make sure you know the basic concepts of music.\nOnce you have a full melody, you can make adjustments to it by changing the notes you use.\nOnce you've learned to play with the basic notes, you can move on to more complex melodies.\nThe next step is to learn how to play with the seventh note, the eighth note, and the ninth note.
