Dialogue: ['\nBaumann:', "\nWell met, adventurer! Thanks to you, I'm feeling a lot more optimistic about the future. There's one last thing I need to discuss before we get to work.\nAs you know, we're beekeepers. Our job is to keep the flowers and vegetables healthy and robust. We need to pollinate them, but we also need to eliminate pests.\nIf we could only eradicate one pest, it would eliminate a whole host of others. A single killed beekeeper could wipe out an entire colony!\nI believe one of the most troublesome pests is the wasp. They burrow into the soil and lay their eggs on the flowers. If we could somehow get rid of the wasps, we'd have a much easier time keeping the flowers healthy.\nWhile we're discussing how we can best tackle this problem, I want you to head into the wood and exterminate a couple of wasps.\nThe nests can be found near the northern and southern gates. You should be able to find a couple by the north gate as well.\n", '\nPop:', '\nA pair of wasps emerges from the soil!', '\nBaumann:', "\nDid you get rid of the wasps?\nIncredible! With your help, we've made it completely impossible for the wasps to spread their poison. I can't thank you enough.\nThis job means a lot to me. Not only do I get to keep my bees, but I get to be an inspiration to everyone. Thanks to you, I'm sure the same can be said for you."]

Dialogue: ['\nEstinien:', "\nIt's good to see you again, Forename. I was hoping you might stop by for a quick chat.\nAfter all, it's you that helped deliver our comrade to Falcon's Nest.

I am glad as well that you both made it here in one piece.\nI suppose I ought to thank you properly. As you know, Falcon's Nest was built to meet the needs of our brave men and women who protect Ishgard─and it is our duty to fulfill that duty.\nBut I also know that it serves as a refuge for those who fled Ishgard's devastation. Indeed, Falcon's Nest is home to many who were forced to abandon their homes.\nIn fact, Falcon's Nest was created as a place where they might continue their studies while they awaited their eventual return to Ishgard.\nFor the most part, the refugees who live there are those who were forced to abandon their homes. A small but important number of them are our own, however.\nAnd as I said, a small but important number of them are our own. For that reason, it has been our responsibility to provide for their needs.\nBut I am afraid I must be going. As I mentioned before, I must head back to Falcon's Nest. Please give my regards to Ser Estinien on our way out."]

Dialogue: ['\nEilis:', "\nWelcome, honored guest, to the Autumn Gardens.\nThe gardens are maintained by the Order of the Twin Adder, and are renowned for their beauty.\nIn fact, they are so renowned that they are honored as a botanical garden within the Azure Dragoon's Respite.\nThe gardens are home to a variety of plants and animals, but they are also home to a parasitic organism─the treant, if you will.\nThe treant is an extremely dangerous creature, and one that must be removed from the gardens at all costs.\nI would be grateful if you could exterminate four of the pests. I will wait here until you have done so.\nPlease make sure to do so in the proper order. The treant will be quite upset should you kill it in the wrong order.", '\nPop:', '\nThe treant is no longer under your control!', '\nEilis:', '\nThank you, honored guest. I take it you were able to rid the gardens of the treant?\nIt is a terrible thing to lose a plant, but treants are essential to keeping the gardens healthy. Without their protection, the flowers would wither and perish.\nThe treant was first spotted in the gardens in the late spring and has been a constant source of trouble ever since.\nIt is truly a shame that it has to be so harmful to our plants, but we cannot very well keep it in the gardens. It must be eliminated from the realm if we are to maintain their beauty.\nIt is with great regret that I inform you that the treant is to be eliminated from the gardens. It pains me to say this, but we cannot preserve the gardens for future generations by keeping its presence in the realm.\nOnly by eliminating the treant can we ensure that they remain beautiful in the years to come. I pray that you will not have to see it, but know that we cannot suffer it.\nI apologize for asking you to eliminate a species of pest so abruptly, but I fear it would be in the best interests of both the plants and the realm if you did so.\nPlease inform the others that the treant shall be eliminated from the gardens at once. You will need their help to do so."]

Dialogue: ['\nMozu:', '\nAh, Forename! Thanks to your tireless efforts, I am one step closer to completing my research. I could not have achieved such a complete and utter success without your assistance.\nBefore I could finish my work, however, I needed to submit my findings to a peer review board.\nI was initially approved to review publications that dealt with subjects as diverse as plant physiology and pathological pathological gambling.\nBut recently, I have been asked to scrutinize a monograph on the art of deception.\nYou see, the author presents a wealth of new data that I am ill equipped to analyze. I am loath to waste valuable time reviewing publications which may well be of interest to others.\nPlease, go to the literature search and locate the deception monograph. Review its contents, and submit any conclusions you come across to my colleague, Ser Aymeric.\nI realize this may seem like a trivial matter, but you have a tremendous amount of influence over this field of study.

You found something?\nYes, I suppose it is worthy of replication.\nI would be honored to do so, of course, but I need time to analyze the results. I will be here when you have more to show me.\nPlease, take this for your troubles. I will see to the rest.\nOh, and before you ask, I have not received any grants for my work. I do so much of my research free of charge because it is possible that one day my research will be published.\nI had hoped to receive such a grant, but I fear I will need more time to finish my work if I am to submit it to a journal.\nPlease accept this as a token of my gratitude."]
