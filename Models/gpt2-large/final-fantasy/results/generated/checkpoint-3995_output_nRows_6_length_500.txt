I gather you've heard rumors of the Crystal Exarch, have you not?\nI doubt many outsiders know aught of him─not even his fellow Scions, I suppose. But since you're here, perhaps you can enlighten me.\nYou see, word has it the Exarch struck a deal with a dragon during the recent stand against Eorzea.\nRumors have it the dragon was slain in the process, and the sword that was found at the scene of the crime has been claimed as a trophy by the Sultansworn.\nThe Sultansworn have long held a grudge against the heretics, and any member of their order who participates in the slaying of dragons is deemed a traitor.\nThis has made acquiring the sword a difficult task for many, but not impossible. The Sultansworn have been known to take swords from those who turn their back on the Empire.\nI suppose it is only a matter of time before the Exarch's accomplices are found and brought to justice.\nBut I am more concerned with the man himself. If he is truly a traitor, then why has he remained silent?\nIf the Sultansworn were to take up the sword in question and begin a campaign of bloodshed, the rest of the Exarch's friends and comrades would no doubt join the fight. It would be only a matter of time before the Sultansworn took up the sword in his stead.\nI cannot help but fear this is the case. But I cannot despair. I know not how much truth there is to these rumors, but I must press on.\nI have been following the developments in Revenant's Toll with great interest.

It was during one of our many battles that the Exarch made a promise to the Sultansworn.\nHe promised to fight for them until the day he died.

Very good.\nA gift for a dear old friend? This is a very appropriate arrangement.\nAs you have doubtless noticed, my instruments bear the seal of Halone. Though I have no interest in showing my face, I thought it might be fitting to give you a present that honours your appreciation.\nA fine choice. Though I suppose it is not suitable for playing at the moment. Allow me to explain.\nI make wares for the wealthy and famous who desire fine music. Though I do not make the products myself, I make sure they are in high demand. Thus when a client requests that I make a gift for them, it is a no-brainer.\

Dialogue: ['\nCibleroit:', "\nYou have an air of dangerous competence, which is well matched by your forbearance. I would be most appreciative if you could aid our cause in its planning.\nThe Order of the Twin Adder wishes to summon an Azure Dragoon from the Azure Dragoon's Respite.\nThe Dragoon who stands in its way is an Azure Dragoon of the highest rank─the Azure Dragoon Grand Company.\nThe company was created to protect the interests of House Durendaire, and is commanded by Master Cibleroit.\nThe Azure Dragoon is responsible for the safety of all who come within its purview. It is for this reason that the Azure Dragoon must be made an offer it cannot refuse.\nThe order has been charged with the procurement of arms and armor, both new and ancient. It is my hope that you will be called upon to assist in the selection of these ancient relics.\nIf you are of a mind to accept the task, pray speak with Wlveva. Wlveva can furnish you with the necessary funds.\nYou are aware that Wlveva is the sister of Mistress Serendipity, the Durendaire representative for the Holy See. It is imperative that you convey the understanding that your services are not to be used for the summoning of an Azure Dragoon.\n", '\nWlveva:', "\nAh, Forename, so good of you to return. The matter of the Azure Dragoon has been discussed at length.\nI will not pretend I am not a firm believer in the power of summoning. Indeed, I have made it my business to study the Azure Dragoon and his powers.\nHowever, I must confess that my evaluation is more tempered than usual.\nWhen one of my countrymen is summoned, it is not merely because I believe he is fit to serve, but because I have been given the authority to do so by the Azure Dragoon himself.\nI have no doubt that Mistress Serendipity will be more than a little pleased to hear that you have agreed to assist her."]
