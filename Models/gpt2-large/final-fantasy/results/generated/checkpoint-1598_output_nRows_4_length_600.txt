However, I am confident that you can find a use for such an unusual flower.\nTake care and I shall see that you are rewarded for your efforts.", '\nCharmont:', '\nWere you able to find a use for this flower?', '\nCharmont:', "\nThis is an excellent result! It is truly a wonder that such a flower could exist!\nI can only assume that the petals and stem were produced using the same method as the flower's petals.\nI have made a rather large discovery, which I would very much like to share with you.\nI have found that the petals and stem of the flower have an effect on the surrounding flora.\nI believe that these flowers are of great benefit to those who work in agriculture.\nI shall make sure to pass on this information to my colleagues.\nI shall see that you are rewarded for your efforts."]
