The hatchling has grown bolder and bolder. It will learn that the wild stalkers of the river are not the only threats to it.

It will also grow bolder as we deal with the naga threat to the river.

I have sent an expedition to search for Sharptalon. The expedition is from Nazjatar, so I am sure they will find him.

You are not to go alone, {name}. I have seen the hatchling fight with the naga and they are not afraid of us.

Go to the island on the eastern shore of Nazjatar and speak with my alpha male. He has been sent here to look for Sharptalon.

Take this talisman and use it to free him from the talisman of the naga.Hand-in: <You feel the talisman's power surge through you.>It is time, <name>. You have proven yourself a great ally. I have a feeling that you will return.
